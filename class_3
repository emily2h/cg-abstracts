"Characterization of mutations in the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor gene in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and frequency of these mutations in FH patients in the United Kingdom. || Adolescent Adult Base Sequence Child Female Gene Deletion Heterozygote Homozygote Humans Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II Male Middle Aged Molecular Sequence Data Mutation Pedigree Phenotype Point Mutation Receptors, LDL United Kingdom || Mutations in the gene for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor have been identified in 15 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Five patients are homozygous at the LDL-receptor locus; their mutant alleles include Glu387Lys and Pro664Leu in patients of Asian-Indian descent, Cys292Stop in a Greek Cypriot, Cys281Trp in a Turkish patient, and Gln 540Stop in a West Indian. The other 10 patients (9 of apparently British ancestry) are compound heterozygotes. Mutations have been identified in 18 of 20 possible alleles, including Glu80Lys (2 patients), Pro664Leu (3 patients), Asp69Gly, Cys176Arg, Cys227Tyr, Ser265Arg, Asp280Ala, Asp283Glu, Arg329Pro, Asp461Asn, Leu578Ser, a single bp deletion in exon 15, a 21 bp duplication of codons 200-206 and two large deletions. The seven mutations underlined above have not been described previously. The two uncharacterized mutant alleles fail to produce detectable amounts of mRNA. LDL-receptor activity in cultured cells from 13 of the 15 homozygous patients varied from undetectable to about 30% of normal, but there was no correlation between LDL-receptor activity and the untreated plasma cholesterol concentration in these patients. When genomic DNA from 295 patients with a clinical diagnosis of FH was screened for 29 mutations found in these and other FH patients of British ancestry, most were identified in only one or a few individuals. Four patients heterozygous for the Asp461Asn allele showed a wide range of clinical manifestations. These observations confirm the striking heterogeneity underlying FH in most populations and demonstrate the variability in phenotype between patients with the same mutation.",2 4 3
"De novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathies. || Child Development Disorders, Pervasive Cohort Studies Exome Female Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein Genetic Predisposition to Disease Humans Infant Intellectual Disability Lennox Gastaut Syndrome Male Mutation Mutation Rate N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases Probability Receptors, GABA-A Spasms, Infantile || Epileptic encephalopathies are a devastating group of severe childhood epilepsy disorders for which the cause is often unknown. Here we report a screen for de novo mutations in patients with two classical epileptic encephalopathies: infantile spasms (n = 149) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n = 115). We sequenced the exomes of 264 probands, and their parents, and confirmed 329 de novo mutations. A likelihood analysis showed a significant excess of de novo mutations in the ∼4,000 genes that are the most intolerant to functional genetic variation in the human population (P = 2.9 × 10(-3)). Among these are GABRB3, with de novo mutations in four patients, and ALG13, with the same de novo mutation in two patients; both genes show clear statistical evidence of association with epileptic encephalopathy. Given the relevant site-specific mutation rates, the probabilities of these outcomes occurring by chance are P = 4.1 × 10(-10) and P = 7.8 × 10(-12), respectively. Other genes with de novo mutations in this cohort include CACNA1A, CHD2, FLNA, GABRA1, GRIN1, GRIN2B, HNRNPU, IQSEC2, MTOR and NEDD4L. Finally, we show that the de novo mutations observed are enriched in specific gene sets including genes regulated by the fragile X protein (P < 10(-8)), as has been reported previously for autism spectrum disorders.",3
"Molecular basis of phenylketonuria and a correlation between genotype and phenotype in a heterogeneous southeastern US population. || Alleles Base Sequence Ethnic Groups Europe Forecasting Gene Expression Regulation Genetics, Population Genotype Georgia Heterozygote Humans Infant, Newborn Molecular Biology Mutation Neonatal Screening Phenotype Phenylalanine Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence Analysis || To determine the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (PKU) and related hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) and to establish correlations between phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes and biochemical and clinical phenotypes in an ethnically diverse US population, PAH genotypes were determined in 35 patients with PKU or HPA and 1 carrier from the Medical Genetics Clinic of the Emory University School of Medicine. Patients were identified through Georgia's population-based newborn screening program. PAH genotypes in these individuals were determined from dried blood spots or whole-blood samples using a combination of polymerase chain reaction-mediated amplification, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct-sequence analysis. The phenotypic severity of patients with PKU and HPA was based on pretreatment serum phenylalanine (PHE) levels during the neonatal period and on dietary tolerance of PHE later in life. Sixty-eight (96%) of 71 mutant alleles were identified. Major mutations in this population included R408W (11 of 71), I65T (11 of 71), Y414C (6 of 71), L348V (4 of 71), and IVS10 (4 of 71). Five new nucleotide substitutions, E76A (1 of 71), R241L (1 of 71), Q304R (2 of 71), C334S (1 of 71), and R400R (2 of 71) were also detected. Thirty-two of the thirty-five nonrelated patients examined in this study were completely genotyped. Strong correlations were observed between the level of PAH activity predicted from the genotype, when known from previous in vitro expression studies of the mutant proteins, and pretreatment serum PHE levels (r = .841) or clinical severity (Kendall rank-order correlation coefficient, .936). These results demonstrate strong correlations between PAH genotype and biochemical and clinical phenotypes in this heterogeneous American sample population, extending our previous findings from relatively homogeneous European populations. These correlations further demonstrate the clinical utility of genotype analysis in the treatment of patients with PKU and HPA.",3 1
"Co-existence of phenylketonuria either with maple syrup urine disease or Sandhoff disease in two patients from Iran: emphasizing the role of consanguinity. || Adult Amino Acid Sequence Biomarkers Consanguinity Female Genetic Testing Humans Infant Infant, Newborn Iran Male Maple Syrup Urine Disease Metabolism, Inborn Errors Mutation Pedigree Phenylketonurias Polymerase Chain Reaction Sandhoff Disease Sequence Homology, Amino Acid beta-Hexosaminidase beta Chain || Most inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. IEMs are one of the major concerns in Iran due to its extensive consanguineous marriages. Herein, we report two patients with two co-existent IEMs: a girl affected by classic phenylketonuria (PKU) and maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) and a male patient affected with Sandhoff disease and PKU, where Sandhoff disease was suspected due to the presence of a cherry-red spot in the eyes at 6 months which is unrelated to PKU. Sequencing of candidate genes in the first patient revealed one novel and three recurrent compound heterozygous mutations of p.Ser231Pro and p.Ala300Ser in the PAH gene and p.Glu330Lys and p.Arg170Cys mutations in the BCKDHB gene. Genetic testing results in the second patient showed previously reported homozygous mutations of p.Arg261Gln in the PAH and p.Arg533Cys mutation in the HEXB gene. Genetic testing confirmed the clinical diagnosis of both diseases in both patients. To the best of our knowledge; this is the first report of the co-existence of two distinct genetic disorders in two individuals from Iran. Co-existent different IEMs in patients complicated the clinical diagnosis and management of the diseases.",3
"Germline mutations in the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in patients with Cowden disease. || Adult Chromosome Mapping Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10 DNA Mutational Analysis Female Genes, Tumor Suppressor Germ-Line Mutation Hamartoma Syndrome, Multiple Humans Male PTEN Phosphohydrolase Pedigree Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases Tumor Suppressor Proteins || Cowden disease, also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome with a high risk of breast and thyroid cancer. The gene involved has been localized to chromosome 10q22-23. Recently, the tumour suppressor gene PTEN/MMAC1, encoding a putative protein tyrosine or dual-specificity phosphatase, was cloned from that region and three mutations were detected in patients with Cowden disease. We confirmed that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene is indeed the gene for Cowden disease by a refined localization of the gene to the interval between D10S1761 and D10S541, which contains the PTEN/MMAC1 gene and, by mutation analysis in eight unrelated familial and 11 sporadic patients with Cowden disease. Eight different mutations were detected in various regions of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene. One mutation was detected twice. All detected changes in the gene can be predicted to have a very deleterious effect on the putative protein. Five of the nine patients have a mutation in exon 5 coding for the putative active site and flanking amino acids. Evaluation of the clinical data of the patients in which a mutation could be detected gives no clear indications for a correlation between the genotype and phenotype. In 10 patients no mutation could be detected so far. In support of the linkage data, no evidence has emerged from the phenotype of these patients suggestive for genetic heterogeneity.",3
