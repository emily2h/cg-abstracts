1,"Brain somatic mutations in MTOR cause focal cortical dysplasia type II leading to intractable epilepsy.  Focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) is a sporadic developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by dysmorphic neurons, dyslamination and medically refractory epilepsy. It has been hypothesized that FCD is caused by somatic mutations in affected regions. Here, we used deep whole-exome sequencing (read depth, 412-668×) validated by site-specific amplicon sequencing (100-347,499×) in paired brain-blood DNA from four subjects with FCDII and uncovered a de novo brain somatic mutation, mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) c.7280T>C (p.Leu2427Pro) in two subjects. Deep sequencing of the MTOR gene in an additional 73 subjects with FCDII using hybrid capture and PCR amplicon sequencing identified eight different somatic missense mutations found in multiple brain tissue samples of ten subjects. The identified mutations accounted for 15.6% of all subjects with FCDII studied (12 of 77). The identified mutations induced the hyperactivation of mTOR kinase. Focal cortical expression of mutant MTOR by in utero electroporation in mice was sufficient to disrupt neuronal migration and cause spontaneous seizures and cytomegalic neurons. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin suppressed cytomegalic neurons and epileptic seizures. This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that brain somatic activating mutations in MTOR cause FCD and identifies mTOR as a treatment target for intractable epilepsy in FCD.",0
1,"Inherited Disease Genetics Improves the Identification of Cancer-Associated Genes.  The identification of biologically significant variants in cancer genomes is critical to therapeutic discovery, but it is limited by the statistical power needed to discern driver from passenger. Independent biological data can be used to filter cancer exomes and increase statistical power. Large genetic databases for inherited diseases are uniquely suited to this task because they contain specific amino acid alterations with known pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms. However, no rigorous method to overlay this information onto the cancer exome exists. Here, we present a computational methodology that overlays any variant database onto the somatic mutations in all cancer exomes. We validate the computation experimentally and identify novel associations in a re-analysis of 7362 cancer exomes. This analysis identified activating SOS1 mutations associated with Noonan syndrome as significantly altered in melanoma and the first kinase-activating mutations in ACVR1 associated with adult tumors. Beyond a filter, significant variants found in both rare cancers and rare inherited diseases increase the unmet medical need for therapeutics that target these variants and may bootstrap drug discovery efforts in orphan indications.",0
1,"Insights into the structural biology of Gaucher disease.  Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the acid-β-glucosidase lysosomal hydrolase enzyme that cleaves glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide. Reduced enzyme activity and impaired structural stability arise due to >300 known disease-causing mutations. Several of these mutations have also been associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD). Since the discovery of the acid-β-glucosidase X-ray structure, there have been major advances in our understanding of the structural properties of the protein. Analysis of specific residues has provided insight into their functional and structural importance and provided insight into the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease and the contribution to PD. Disease-causing mutations are positioned throughout the acid-β-glucosidase structure, with many located far from the active site and thus retaining some enzymatic activity however, thus far no clear relationship between mutation location and disease severity has been established. Here, we review the crystal structure of acid-β-glucosidase, while highlighting important structural aspects of the protein in detail. This review discusses the structural stability of acid-β-glucosidase, which can be altered by pH and glycosylation, and explores the relationship between known Gaucher disease and PD mutations, structural stability and disease severity.",0
1,"Degradation of LDLR protein mediated by 'gain of function' PCSK9 mutants in normal and ARH cells.  Dominant gain-of-function mutations in proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) cause familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and result in accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease. It is believed that PCSK9 binds to LDL-receptor (LDLR) protein and prevents its recycling to the cell surface; gain-of-function PCSK9 mutants enhance LDLR degradation. Several new variants of PCSK9 have been identified, but their effect on PCSK9 activity has not been determined. We describe a new procedure for assessing the activity of four putative gain-of-function mutations identified in FH patients (D129N, D374H, N425S, R496W). All four mutant proteins were secreted normally from transfected HEK293T cells. Immortalized lymphocytes from normolipaemic controls were incubated with conditioned medium from transfected cells and cell-surface LDLR protein was determined by FACS. D374H was as potent as D374Y in reducing cell-surface LDLR, while the other three mutations were more potent than wild type, but less so than the D374 mutants; this correlated with total serum cholesterol in the patients. Substitution of different amino acids at 374 showed that aspartate in this position was critical; even glutamate at residue 374 increased LDLR degradation. When the assay was carried out with ARH-negative lymphocytes that are unable to internalise the LDLR, D374Y-PCSK9 was able to reduce cell-surface LDLR by 35%, compared with approximately 70% for normal lymphocytes. Thus, PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation is not entirely dependent on ARH function. We propose a novel ARH-independent pathway for PCSK9 activity on LDLR.",0
1,"Missense mutations in the insulin promoter factor-1 gene predispose to type 2 diabetes.  The transcription factor insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1) plays a central role in both the development of the pancreas and the regulation of insulin gene expression in the mature pancreatic beta cell. A dominant-negative frameshift mutation in the IPF-l gene was identified in a single family and shown to cause pancreatic agenesis when homozygous and maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) when heterozygous. We studied the role of IPF-1 in Caucasian diabetic and nondiabetic subjects from the United Kingdom. Three novel IPF-1 missense mutations (C18R, D76N, and R197H) were identified in patients with type 2 diabetes. Functional analyses of these mutations demonstrated decreased binding activity to the human insulin gene promoter and reduced activation of the insulin gene in response to hyperglycemia in the human beta-cell line Nes2y. These mutations are present in 1% of the population and predisposed the subject to type 2 diabetes with a relative risk of 3.0. They were not highly penetrant MODY mutations, as there were nondiabetic mutation carriers 25-53 years of age. We conclude that mutations in the IPF-1 gene may predispose to type 2 diabetes and are a rare cause of MODY and pancreatic agenesis, with the phenotype depending upon the severity of the mutation.",0
1,"Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in Chinese MODY families: prevalence and functional analysis.  Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes characterised by an early age of onset (usually <25 years). We investigated the prevalence and trans-activating activity of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) -1 alpha mutations in southern Chinese families with MODY. We screened for mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene in 50 unrelated southern Chinese families, which fulfilled the minimum criteria for MODY. Functional properties of the mutant proteins were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase reporter assay. Five of the 50 (10%) families were found to have mutations in the coding region, including a new nonsense mutation Q176X and four reported mutations (frameshift mutation P379fsdelCT, nonsense mutation R171X, missense mutations G20R and P112L). These mutations had decreased trans-activating activity on the human insulin gene promoter. We also detected a new intronic sequence variation IVS7nt-6 G-->A, which co-segregated with diabetes. The intronic variation creates a potential splice acceptor site and might alter the splicing of the HNF-1 alpha mRNA. Mutations in the HNF-1 alpha gene seem to be an important cause of MODY in southern Chinese. The mutations could affect normal islet function by altering the expression of target genes.",0
1,"Hypertriglyceridaemia and low plasma HDL in a patient with apolipoprotein A-V deficiency due to a novel mutation in the APOA5 gene.  APOA5 encodes a novel apolipoprotein (apo A-V) which appears to be a modulator of plasma triglyceride (TG). In apoA5 knock out mice plasma TG level increases almost fourfold, whereas in human APOA5 transgenic mice it decreases by 70%. Some SNPs in the APOA5 gene have been associated with variations in plasma TG in humans. In addition, hypertriglyceridaemic (HTG) patients have been identified who carried rare nonsense mutations in the APOA5 gene (Q139X and Q148X), predicted to result in apo A-V deficiency. In this study we report a 17-year-old male with high TG and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), who at the age of two had been found to have severe HTG and eruptive xanthomas suggesting a chylomicronaemia syndrome. Plasma postheparin LPL activity, however, was normal and no mutations were found in LPL and APOC2 genes. The sequence of APOA5 gene revealed that the patient was homozygous for a point mutation (c.289 C>T) in exon 4, converting glutamine codon at position 97 into a termination codon (Q97X). Apo A-V was not detected in patient's plasma, indicating that he had complete apo A-V deficiency. The administration of a low-fat and low-oligosaccharide diet, either alone or supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids, started early in life, reduced plasma TG to a great extent but had a negligible effect on plasma HDL-C. Loss of function mutations of APOA5 gene may be the cause of severe HTG in patients without mutations in LPL and APOC2 genes.",0
1,"IPF-1/MODY4 gene missense mutation in an Italian family with type 2 and gestational diabetes.  Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic autosomal-dominant form of diabetes mellitus with onset before 25 years of age. Genetic variation in insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF1) (MODY4) is uncommon but may contribute to early- or late-onset diabetes as part of a polygenic background. IPF1 is a homeodomain transcription factor required for pancreas development. Our aim was to identify whether IPF1 gene mutations play a role in Italian early-onset type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients and what functional impact mutations may have in the beta cell. We screened 40 Italian early-onset type 2 diabetic probands for IPF1 mutations, performed oral glucose tolerance tests in the unaffected family members, and performed in vitro functional studies of the mutant variant. In an extended family (Italy-6) of 46 members with clinical phenotypes of gestational diabetes, MODY, and T2D, a single nucleotide change of CCT to ACT was identified at codon 33 resulting in a Pro to Thr substitution (P33T) in the IPF1 transactivation domain that also contributes to an altered metabolic status in the unaffected NM subjects. Of the 22 genotyped Italy-6 members, 9 carried the P33T allele (NM), of whom 5 have either T2D or elevated fasting glucose levels. Oral glucose tolerance tests showed higher glucose levels at 90 minutes in unaffected NM compared with unaffected NN subjects. Of the 5 female pregnant carriers of the IPF1 mutation, 4 had pregnancies complicated by reduced birth weights, miscarriages, or early postnatal deaths. In studies in vitro, the IPF1 mutant protein (P33T) showed a reduction in DNA-binding and transcriptional activation functions as compared to the wild-type IPF1 protein. Our findings suggest that the P33T IPF1 mutation may provide an increased susceptibility to the development of gestational diabetes and MODY4 in the Italy-6 pedigree.",0
1,"The p.R482W substitution in A-type lamins deregulates SREBP1 activity in Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy.  Nuclear lamins are involved in many cellular functions due to their ability to bind numerous partners including chromatin and transcription factors, and affect their properties. Dunnigan type familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD2; OMIM#151660) is caused in most cases by the A-type lamin R482W mutation. We report here that the R482W mutation affects the regulatory activity of sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), a transcription factor that regulates hundreds of genes involved in lipid metabolism and adipocyte differentiation. Using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA), reporter assays and biochemical and transcriptomic approaches, we show that interactions of SREBP1 with lamin A and lamin C occur at the nuclear periphery and in the nucleoplasm. These interactions involve the Ig-fold of A-type lamins and are favored upon SREBP1 binding to its DNA target sequences. We show that SREBP1, LMNA and sterol response DNA elements form ternary complexes in vitro. In addition, overexpression of A-type lamins reduces transcriptional activity of SREBP1. In contrast, both overexpression of LMNA R482W in primary human preadipocytes and endogenous expression of A-type lamins R482W in FPLD2 patient fibroblasts, reduce A-type lamins-SREBP1 in situ interactions and upregulate a large number of SREBP1 target genes. As this LMNA mutant was previously shown to inhibit adipogenic differentiation, we propose that deregulation of SREBP1 by mutated A-type lamins constitutes one underlying mechanism of the physiopathology of FPLD2. Our data suggest that SREBP1 targeting molecules could be considered in a therapeutic context.",0
1,"Evidence-based tailoring of bioinformatics approaches to optimize methods that predict the effects of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions in glucokinase.  Computational methods that allow predicting the effects of nonsynonymous substitutions are an integral part of exome studies. Here, we validated and improved their specificity by performing a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental and clinical data on a model of glucokinase (GCK): 8835 putative variations, including 515 disease-associated variations from 1596 families with diagnoses of monogenic diabetes (GCK-MODY) or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (PHHI), and 126 variations with available or newly reported (19 variations) data on enzyme kinetics. We also proved that high frequency of disease-associated variations found in patients is closely related to their evolutionary conservation. The default set prediction methods predicted correctly the effects of only a part of the GCK-MODY-associated variations and completely failed to predict the normoglycemic or PHHI-associated variations. Therefore, we calculated evidence-based thresholds that improved significantly the specificity of predictions (≤75%). The combined prediction analysis even allowed to distinguish activating from inactivating variations and identified a group of putatively highly pathogenic variations (EVmutation score <-7.5 and SNAP2 score >70), which were surprisingly underrepresented among MODY patients and thus under negative selection during molecular evolution. We suggested and validated the first robust evidence-based thresholds, which allow improved, highly specific predictions of disease-associated GCK variations.",0
1,"Clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with Gaucher disease in Southern China.  Gaucher disease (GD) is a common lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of acid β-glucosidase, due to mutations in the GBA gene. To explore the clinical and molecular characteristics of GD patients from Southern China, GBA gene were analyzed by nest PCR and direct Sanger-sequencing. Novel missense mutations were transiently transfected in COS-7 cells by plasmid system for functional verification. Among the 22 GD patients, 19 patients were classified as type 1 and three as type 2. Over 60% of the type 1 patient had the onset before two years of age and about 42% of them died before three years of age. Six type 1 patients with L444P homozygous genotype, presented with early onset and severe hepatosplenomegaly. Four novel mutations Y22C, F109L, L149F and c.983_990delCCCACTGG were identified. The GBA activities in vitro of novel mutants Y22C, F109L and L149F were 20.2%, 6.9% and 6.5% of the wild-type, respectively. L444P mutation accounted for 47.7% of the mutant alleles. Our results revealed that type 1 GD tends to present with a severe phenotype among southern Chinese. L444P was the most prevalent mutation and L444P homozygous genotype was associated with severe type 1 GD. Three novel missense mutations identified were pathogenic.",0
1,"An improved method on stimulated T-lymphocytes to functionally characterize novel and known LDLR mutations.  The main causes of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are mutations in LDL receptor (LDLR) gene. Functional studies are necessary to demonstrate the LDLR function impairment caused by mutations and would be useful as a diagnostic tool if they allow discrimination between FH patients and controls. In order to identify the best method to detect LDLR activity, we compared continuous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphocytes and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocytes. In addition, we characterized both novel and known mutations in the LDLR gene. T-lymphocytes and EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of 24 FH patients and 24 control subjects. Functional assays were performed by incubation with fluorescent LDL followed by flow cytometry analysis. Residual LDLR activity was calculated normalizing fluorescence for the mean fluorescence of controls. With stimulated T-lymphocytes we obtained a better discrimination capacity between controls and FH patients compared with EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes as demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (the areas under the curve are 1.000 and 0.984 respectively; P < 0.0001 both). The characterization of LDLR activity through T-lymphocytes is more simple and faster than the use of EBV-transformed B-lymphocytes and allows a complete discrimination between controls and FH patients. Therefore the evaluation of residual LDLR activity could be helpful not only for mutation characterization but also for diagnostic purposes.",0
1,"Monocytes of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia show alterations in cholesterol metabolism.  Elevated plasma cholesterol promotes the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in which monocyte-derived lipid-laden macrophages are frequently found. To analyze, if circulating monocytes already show increased lipid content and differences in lipoprotein metabolism, we compared monocytes from patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) with those from healthy individuals. Cholesterol and oxidized cholesterol metabolite serum levels of FH and of healthy, gender/age matched control subjects were measured by combined gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy. Monocytes from patients with FH and from healthy subjects were isolated by antibody-assisted density centrifugation. Gene expression profiles of isolated monocytes were measured using Affymetrix HG-U 133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. We compared monocyte gene expression profiles from FH patients with healthy controls using a Welch T-test with correction for multiple testing (p < 0.05; Benjamini Hochberg correction, False Discovery Rate = 0.05). The differential expression of FH associated genes was validated at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR and/or at the protein level by Western Blot or flow cytometry. Functional validation of monocyte scavenger receptor activities were done by binding assays and dose/time dependent uptake analysis using native and oxidized LDL. Using microarray analysis we found in FH patients a significant up-regulation of 1,617 genes and a down-regulation of 701 genes compared to monocytes from healthy individuals. These include genes of proteins that are involved in the uptake, biosynthesis, disposition, and cellular efflux of cholesterol. In addition, plasma from FH patients contains elevated amounts of sterols and oxysterols. An increased uptake of oxidized as well as of native LDL by FH monocytes combined with a down-regulation of NPC1 and ABCA1 explains the lipid accumulation observed in these cells. Our data demonstrate that circulating FH monocytes show differences in cell physiology that may contribute to the early onset of atherosclerosis in this disease.",0
1,"Receptor-associated protein facilitates proper folding and maturation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor and its class 2 mutants.  Familial hypercholesterolemia is the consequence of various mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). In the current study, we show that a specialized molecular chaperone, the receptor-associated protein (RAP), promotes proper folding and subsequent exocytic trafficking of the wild-type LDLR and several of its class 2 mutants. Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP antibody demonstrates that RAP interacts with the LDLR. Kinetic analyses of LDLR posttranslational folding and maturation in the absence or presence of RAP coexpression show that RAP prevents aggregation and promotes the maturation of the LDLR. Additionally, depletion of Ca(2+) in intact cells impairs LDLR folding, and coexpression of RAP partially corrects this misfolding. Finally, we show that the increased mature cell surface LDLR in the presence of RAP coexpression is functional in its ability to endocytose and degrade (125)I-LDL. Taken together, our results show that the folding, trafficking, and maturation of the LDLR and its class 2 mutants are promoted by RAP.",0
1,"AlphaIIbbeta3 integrin: new allelic variants in Glanzmann thrombasthenia, effects on ITGA2B and ITGB3 mRNA splicing, expression, and structure-function.  Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT) is an autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder characterized by an impaired platelet aggregation due to defects in integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (ITGA2B, ITGB3), a fibrinogen receptor. Mutations from 24 GT patients and two carriers of various origins, Caucasian, North-African and Asian were characterized. Promoter and exon sequences of alphaIIb and beta3 genes were amplified and directly sequenced. Among 29 identified mutations, 17 new allelic variants resulting from nonsense, missense and deletion/insertion mutations were described. RNA alterations were evaluated by using Web servers. The alphaIIb p.S926L, p.V903F, and beta3 p.C38Y, p.M118R, p.G221D substitutions prevented complex expression at the surface of COS-7 cells by altering the alphaIIb or the beta3 subunit structure. As shown by free energy analyses applied on the resolved structure of alphaIIbbeta3 and structural modeling of the mutant, the p.K253M substitution of beta3 helped to define a key role of the K253 in the interaction of the alphaIIb beta-propeller and the beta3 beta-I domains. finally, the alphaIIb p.Q595H substitution allowed cell surface expression of the complex but its corresponding c.2800G>T mutation is predicted to alter normal RNA splicing. In conclusion, our study yielded the discovery of 17 new GT allelic variants, revealed the key role of K253 of alphaIIb for the alphaIIbbeta3 complex formation and provides an additional example of an apparently missense mutation causing a splicing defect.",0
1,"The molecular defects in lipoprotein lipase deficient patients.  The underlying molecular defects that lead to a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase in two patients from different kindreds presenting with the familial hyperchylomicronemia syndrome have been identified. Sequence analysis of amplified LPL cDNA of the patient from the Bethesda kindred revealed a single point mutation (G to A) at position 781 of the normal gene that resulted in the substitution of an alanine for a threonine at residue 176 and the loss of an SfaN1 site present in the normal LPL gene. Amplification of patient cDNA by the PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion with SfaN1 established that the patient is a true homozygote for the defect. The proband from the second kindred was found to be a compound heterozygote for two separate allelic mutations, including a T to C transition at nucleotide 836 and a G to A mutation at base 983 that led to the substitution of Ile194 by Thr and Arg243 by His, respectively. Transient expression of the mutant LPL cDNAs from both kindreds in human embryonal kidney-293 cells resulted in the synthesis of enzymatically inactive proteins, establishing the functional significance of the mutations.",0
1,"Amino acid substitution (Ile194----Thr) in exon 5 of the lipoprotein lipase gene causes lipoprotein lipase deficiency in three unrelated probands. Support for a multicentric origin.  Studies on the molecular biology of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency have been facilitated by the availability of LPL gene probes and the recent characterization of gene mutations underlying human LPL deficiency. Typically, missense mutations have predominated and show a preferential localization to exons 4 and 5. This distribution supports earlier studies attributing functional significance to residues encoded by these exons. We now report a further missense mutation within exon 5 of the LPL gene in three unrelated patients. Amplification of individual exons by the polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing revealed a T----C transition at codon 194 of the LPL cDNA which results in a substitution of threonine for isoleucine at this residue. The catalytic abnormality induced by this mutation was confirmed through in vitro mutagenesis studies in COS-1 cells. Transfection with a LPL cDNA containing the codon 194 transition resulted in the synthesis and secretion of a catalytically defective protein. The Thr194 substitution was associated with two different DNA haplotypes, consistent with a multicentric origin for this mutation.",0
1,"Identification of the low density lipoprotein receptor-binding site in apolipoprotein B100 and the modulation of its binding activity by the carboxyl terminus in familial defective apo-B100.  Familial defective apolipoprotein B100 (FDB) is caused by a mutation of apo-B100 (R3500Q) that disrupts the receptor binding of low density lipoproteins (LDL), which leads to hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. In this study, mutant forms of human apo-B were expressed in transgenic mice, and the resulting human recombinant LDL were purified and tested for their receptor-binding activity. Site-directed mutagenesis and other evidence indicated that Site B (amino acids 3,359-3,369) binds to the LDL receptor and that arginine-3,500 is not directly involved in receptor binding. The carboxyl-terminal 20% of apo-B100 is necessary for the R3500Q mutation to disrupt receptor binding, since removal of the carboxyl terminus in FDB LDL results in normal receptor-binding activity. Similarly, removal of the carboxyl terminus of apo-B100 on receptor-inactive VLDL dramatically increases apo-B-mediated receptor-binding activity. We propose that the carboxyl terminus normally functions to inhibit the interaction of apo-B100 VLDL with the LDL receptor, but after the conversion of triglyceride-rich VLDL to smaller cholesterol-rich LDL, arginine-3,500 interacts with the carboxyl terminus, permitting normal interaction between LDL and its receptor. Moreover, the loss of arginine at this site destabilizes this interaction, resulting in receptor-binding defective LDL.",0
1,"Comparison of the genetic defect with LDL-receptor activity in cultured cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Regression Study Group.  In this study we have analyzed the genetic defect in 42 patients with a diagnosis of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) by Southern blotting, SSCP, and sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments of genomic DNA or sequencing of RT-PCR products from mRNA in cultured cells. The apoB Arg3500Gln mutation was identified in five patients. A molecular defect in the LDL-receptor gene was confirmed in 23 patients; 16 of these mutations have not been described before. No defect in the coding region, intron:exon junctions or proximal promoter of the LDL-receptor gene or in the region of the apoB gene coding for the LDL-receptor binding domain was found in the remaining 14 patients. LDL-receptor activity and protein content of cultured lymphoblasts from the patients was significantly lower in cells from patients with severe rather than mild LDL-receptor mutations. Cells from four patients with no detectable defect showed reduced LDL receptor activity compared with eight normal cell lines, whereas six others had reduced LDL-receptor activity but LDL-receptor protein content within the normal range. Cells from four patients appeared to have normal LDL-receptor function. Cells from two patients with a defined defect also had LDL-receptor activity within the normal range. The findings demonstrate the problems involved in the genetic diagnosis of FH in patients.",0
1,"Alterations in bile acid synthesis in carriers of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α mutations.  Heterozygous mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) cause maturity onset diabetes of the young 3 (MODY3), an autosomal dominant form of diabetes. Deficiency of HNF1α in mice results in diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and increased bile acid (BA) and cholesterol synthesis. Little is known about alterations in lipid metabolism in patients with MODY3. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with MODY3 have altered cholesterol and BA synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption. A secondary aim was to investigate the effects of HNF1α mutations on the transcriptional regulation of BA metabolism. Plasma biomarkers of BA and cholesterol synthesis and intestinal cholesterol absorption were measured in patients with MODY3 (n = 19) and in matched healthy control subjects (n = 15). Cotransfection experiments were performed with several promoters involved in BA metabolism along with expression vectors carrying the mutations found in these patients. Plasma analysis showed higher levels of BA synthesis in patients with MODY3. No differences were observed in cholesterol synthesis or intestinal cholesterol absorption. Cotransfection experiments showed that one of the mutations (P379A) increased the induction of the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase promoter compared with HNF1α, without further differences in other studied promoters. By contrast, the other four mutations (L107I, T260M, P291fsinsC and R131Q) reduced the induction of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) promoter, which was followed by reduced repression of the small heterodimer partner promoter. In addition, these mutations also reduced the induction of the apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter promoter. BA synthesis is increased in patients with MODY3 compared with control subjects. Mutations in HNF1α affect promoters involved in BA metabolism.",0
1,"The genetic spectrum of familial hypercholesterolemia in Pakistan.  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the genes coding for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) or apo-lipoprotein B-100 (APOB). The aim of the present work was to determine the genetic basis of dyslipidemia in 11 unrelated Pakistani families. High resolution melting (HRM), sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Probands were screened for the promoter and all coding regions, including intron/exon boundaries, of LDLR and PCSK9 and part of exon 26 of APOB including p.(R3527Q). Two families were identified with previously unreported LDLR mutations (c.1019_1020delinsTG, p.(C340L) and c.1634G>A, p.(G545E)). Both probands had tendon xanthomas or xanthelasma and/or a history of cardiovascular disease. Co-segregation with hypercholesterolemia was demonstrated in both families. In silico studies predicted these variations to be damaging. In two families, novel PCSK9 variations were identified (exon2; c.314G>A, p.(R105Q) and exon3; c.464C>T, p.(P155L)). In silico studies suggested both were likely to be damaging, and family members carrying the p.(105Q) allele had lower total cholesterol levels, suggesting this is a loss-of-function mutation. For c.464C>T p.(P155L) the small number of relatives available precluded any strong inference. This report brings to seven the number of different LDLR mutations reported in FH patients from Pakistan and, as expected in this heterogeneous population, no common LDLR mutation has been identified.",0
1,"Identification and functional analysis of GCK gene mutations in 12 Chinese families with hyperglycemia.  To investigate the clinical and genetic characteristics of Chinese patients with a phenotype consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 and explore the pathogenic mechanism of their hyperglycemia. We studied 12 probands and their extended families referred to our center for screening mutations in the glucokinase gene (GCK). Clinical data were collected and genetic analysis was carried out. The recombinant wild-type and mutant glucokinase were generated in Escherichia coli. The kinetic parameters and thermal stability of the enzymes were determined in vitro. In the 12 families, 11 GCK mutations (R43C, T168A, K169N, R191W, Y215X, E221K, M235T, R250H, W257X, G261R and A379E) and one variant of uncertain significance (R275H) were identified. R191W was detected in two unrelated families. Of the 11 GCK mutations, three mutations (c.507G>C, K169N; c.645C>A, Y215X; c.771G>A, W257X; NM_000162.3, NP_000153.1) are novel. Basic kinetics analysis explained the pathogenicity of the five mutants (R43C, K169N, R191W, E221K and A379E), which showed reduced enzyme activity with relative activity indexes between ~0.001 and 0.5 compared with the wild-type (1.0). In addition, the thermal stabilities of these five mutants were also decreased to varying degrees. However, for R250H and R275H, there was no significant difference in the enzyme activity and thermal stability between the mutants and the wild type. We have identified 11 GCK mutations and one variant of uncertain significance in 12 Chinese families with hyperglycemia. For five GCK mutations (R43C, K169N, R191W, E221K and A379E), the changes in enzyme kinetics and thermostability might be the pathogenic mechanisms by which mutations cause hyperglycemia.",0
1,"De novo germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes.  Megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) and megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndromes are sporadic overgrowth disorders associated with markedly enlarged brain size and other recognizable features. We performed exome sequencing in 3 families with MCAP or MPPH, and our initial observations were confirmed in exomes from 7 individuals with MCAP and 174 control individuals, as well as in 40 additional subjects with megalencephaly, using a combination of Sanger sequencing, restriction enzyme assays and targeted deep sequencing. We identified de novo germline or postzygotic mutations in three core components of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. These include 2 mutations in AKT3, 1 recurrent mutation in PIK3R2 in 11 unrelated families with MPPH and 15 mostly postzygotic mutations in PIK3CA in 23 individuals with MCAP and 1 with MPPH. Our data highlight the central role of PI3K-AKT signaling in vascular, limb and brain development and emphasize the power of massively parallel sequencing in a challenging context of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity combined with postzygotic mosaicism.",0
1,"De novo somatic mutations in components of the PI3K-AKT3-mTOR pathway cause hemimegalencephaly.  De novo somatic mutations in focal areas are well documented in diseases such as neoplasia but are rarely reported in malformation of the developing brain. Hemimegalencephaly (HME) is characterized by overgrowth of either one of the two cerebral hemispheres. The molecular etiology of HME remains a mystery. The intractable epilepsy that is associated with HME can be relieved by the surgical treatment hemispherectomy, allowing sampling of diseased tissue. Exome sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis in paired brain-blood samples from individuals with HME (n = 20 cases) identified de novo somatic mutations in 30% of affected individuals in the PIK3CA, AKT3 and MTOR genes. A recurrent PIK3CA c.1633G>A mutation was found in four separate cases. Identified mutations were present in 8-40% of sequenced alleles in various brain regions and were associated with increased neuronal S6 protein phosphorylation in the brains of affected individuals, indicating aberrant activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. Thus HME is probably a genetically mosaic disease caused by gain of function in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT3-mTOR signaling.",0
1,"The glucocerobrosidase E326K variant predisposes to Parkinson's disease, but does not cause Gaucher's disease.  Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the acid beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA1) gene, responsible for the recessive lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher's disease (GD), are the strongest known risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD). Our aim was to assess the contribution of GBA1 mutations in a series of early-onset PD. One hundred and eighty-five PD patients (with an onset age of ≤50) and 283 age-matched controls were screened for GBA1 mutations by Sanger sequencing. We show that the frequency of GBA1 mutations is much higher in this patient series than in typical late-onset patient cohorts. Furthermore, our results reveal that the most prevalent PD-associated GBA1 mutation is E326K, a variant that does not, when homozygous, cause GD. Our results confirm recent reports that the mutation, E326K, predisposes to PD and suggest that, in addition to reduced GBA1 activity, other molecular mechanisms may contribute to the development of the disease.",0
1,"Expression and functional characterization of mutated glucocerebrosidase alleles causing Gaucher disease in Spanish patients.  Gaucher disease (GD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by an impaired activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase. This heterogeneity is attributed in part to the existence of a large number of mutations in the corresponding gene. To establish genotype-phenotype relationships, we analyzed the residual enzyme activities of six naturally occurring mutations found in Spanish population in the glucocerebrosidase gene [c.160G > A (V15M), c.485T>C (M123T), c.914C>T (P266L), c.1124T>C (L336P), c.1207A>C (S364R) and c.1510-1512delTCT (S465del)]. The mutated genes were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCR 3.1 and expressed by transient transfection in COS cells. The enzymatic activity of the expressed protein were measured and compared with the wild-type human glucocerebrosidase cDNA. Also, two previously alleles, c.1226A>G (N370S) and c.1448T>C (L444P), were used for comparative purposes. The residual activity of the expressed proteins using the synthetic substrate (4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 4MU-Glu) ranged from 5.5% (for the 3-bp deletion) to 42.7% (for S364R mutation) of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. The present analyses may help to better understand the molecular basis and the pathogenesis of Gaucher disease. However, results of expression of mutated enzymes are necessary but not sufficient to explain the ultimate clinical outcome of Gaucher disease.",0
1,"Pancreas duodenum homeobox-1 transcriptional activation requires interactions with p300.  The homeodomain transcription factor, pancreas duodenum homeobox (PDX)-1, is essential for pancreas development, insulin production, and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in pdx-1(ipf-1) are associated both with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and type 2 diabetes. PDX-1 interacts with multiple transcription factors and coregulators, including the coactivator p300, to activate the transcription of the insulin gene and other target genes within pancreatic beta-cells. In characterizing the protein-protein interactions of PDX-1 and p300, we identified mutations in PDX-1 that disrupt its function and are associated with increased or decreased interactions with p300. Several mutant PDX-1 proteins that are associated with heritable forms of diabetes in humans, in particular the mutant P63fsdelC, exhibited increased binding to a carboxy-terminal segment of p300 in the setting of decreased DNA-binding activities, suggesting that sequestration of p300 by mutant PDX-1 proteins may be an additional mechanism by which insulin gene expression is reduced in heterozygous carriers of pdx-1(ipf-1) mutations. The introduction of the point mutations S66A/Y68A in the highly conserved amino-terminal PDX-1 transactivation domain reduced the ability of PDX-1 to interact with p300, substantially diminished the transcriptional activation of PDX-1, and reduced the synergistic activation of glucose-responsive insulin promoter enhancer sequences by PDX-1, E12, and E47. We propose that interactions of PDX-1 with p300 are required for the transcriptional activation of PDX-1 target genes. Impairment of interactions between PDX-1 and p300 in pancreatic beta-cells may limit insulin production and lead to the development of diabetes.",0
