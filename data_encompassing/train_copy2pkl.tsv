phenylketonuria mutations in northern china.  mutation spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene in patients with phenylketonuria (pku) in northern china is described with a discussion on genotype-phenotype correlation. by using pcr/sscp and dna sequencing, all exons of pah gene in the 185 unrelated patients with pku from northern china were studied. a total of 70 different mutations, including 42 missense, 12 splice, 7 nonsense, 5 deletion, 3 insertion, and 1 silence/splice mutations, were detected in 349/370 mutant alleles (94.3%). deletion, insertion, and frameshift mutations were found for the first time in china pku patients. the mutations r243q, ex6-96a>g, r111x, y356x, and r413p were the prevalent mutations with relative frequencies of 22.2, 11.1, 8.7, 6.5, and 6.5%, respectively. fifteen novel mutations were identified in this study: i38fsx19, ivs4+3g>c, y154h, r157k, r157i, t200fsx6, q267h, q267e, f302fsx39, g346r, s349a, l367l, r400k, ivs12+4a>g, and ivs12+6t>a. each of them occurs at very low frequency (0.3-1.1%). the mutation spectrum of pku in chinese is similar to other asian populations but significantly different from european populations. altogether, 70 different mutations are found in 109 genotypes distributed among 185 pku patients. as shown by the analysis, the predicted residual activity found in the majority of pku individuals match their in vivo phenotypes, though evidence is also found for both phenotypic inconsistencies among subjects with similar genotypes and discordance between the in vitro and in vivo effects of some mutant alleles. the study enables us to construct a national database in china serving as a valuable tool for genetic counseling and prognostic evaluation of future cases of pku.	-1
mapk activation in mature cataract associated with noonan syndrome.  noonan syndrome is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease; it is physically characterized by short stature, short neck, webbed neck, abnormal auricles, high arched palate, and cardiovascular malformation. its pathological condition is thought to be due to a gain-of-function mutation in the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signal transduction pathway. eyelid abnormalities such as ocular hypertelorism and blepharoptosis are the most commonly observed eye complications. we report a case of noonan syndrome associated with mature cataract that required operation. a 42-year-old man was diagnosed with noonan syndrome at the age of 1 year. he underwent an eye examination after complaining of decreased visual acuity in the right eye and was diagnosed with mature cataract, which was treated by cataract surgery. there were no intraoperative complications, and the postoperative course was uneventful. protein analysis of lens capsule and epithelium at capsulorhexis showed mapk cascade proteins such as erk and p38mapk were upregulated. an abnormality in the ptpn11 gene was also observed; a potential mechanism of cataract onset may be that opacity of the lens rapidly progressed due to abnormal activation of the ras-mapk signal transduction pathway. this case highlights the possible association of cataract formation with mapk cascade protein upregulation in noonan syndrome.	-1
molecular basis of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia: assessment in a large cohort of hypercholesterolemic children.  autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (adh) is characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and premature cardiovascular disease. mutations in the genes encoding for low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), apolipoprotein b (apob), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (pcsk9) underlie adh. nevertheless, a proportion of individuals who exhibit the adh phenotype do not carry mutations in any of these 3 genes. estimates of the percentage of such cases among the adh phenotype vary widely. we therefore investigated a large pediatric population with an unequivocal adh phenotype to assess the molecular basis of hereditary hypercholesterolemia and to define the percentage of individuals with unexplained dyslipidemia. we enrolled individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels above the 95th percentile for age and gender and an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of hypercholesterolemia from a large referred pediatric cohort of 1430 children. we excluded children with thyroid dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome, autoimmune disease, liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, and obesity (body mass index >75th percentile for age and gender), as well as children referred via a cascade screening program and those from families with a known molecular diagnosis. of the 269 children who remained after the exclusion criteria were applied, 255 (95%) carried a functional mutation (ldlr, 95%; apob, 5%). in the vast majority of children with an adh phenotype, a causative mutation can be identified, strongly suggesting that most of the large-effect genes underlying adh are known to date.	-1
acute progression of neuromuscular findings in infantile pompe disease.  a 2-year-old girl with pompe disease developed an acute worsening of muscle weakness during a hospitalization, and required intubation for an upper respiratory infection. electromyography and nerve conduction studies produced results consistent with a severe chronic motor axonal peripheral polyneuropathy, with no evidence of reinnervation. magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated generalized hypomyelination and parenchymal volume loss, whereas magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggested neuronal injury and hypomyelination. this case provides compelling evidence for a slowly progressive neurodegenerative process in patients with infantile pompe disease, affecting the motor neurons. routine electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging should be considered to delineate the presence of a neurodegenerative process in infantile-onset pompe disease.	-1
a novel mutation of the gaa gene in a patient with adult-onset pompe disease lacking a disease-specific pathology.  we herein report a novel compound heterozygous mutation of the acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) gene in a 23-year-old man with adult-onset pompe disease. the patient was admitted for respiratory failure and a highly elevated serum level of creatine kinase (ck). his muscle pathology did not show typical vacuolated fibers; however, globular inclusion bodies with acid phosphatase (acp) activity was observed. a molecular genetic analysis of the gaa gene revealed a novel compound heterozygous mutation, c.1544 t>a (m515k), combined with a previously reported mutation, c.1309 c>t (r437c). the presence of acp-positive globular inclusion bodies is a useful diagnostic marker for adult-onset pompe disease, even when typical vacuolated fibers are absent.	-1
cardiovascular risk assessment of dyslipidemic children: analysis of biomarkers to identify monogenic dyslipidemia.  the distinction between a monogenic dyslipidemia and a polygenic/environmental dyslipidemia is important for the cardiovascular risk assessment, counseling, and treatment of these patients. the present work aims to perform the cardiovascular risk assessment of dyslipidemic children to identify useful biomarkers for clinical criteria improvement in clinical settings. main cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed in a cohort of 237 unrelated children with clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). about 40% carried at least two cardiovascular risk factors and 37.6% had fh, presenting mutations in ldlr and apob. fh children showed significant elevated atherogenic markers and lower concentration of antiatherogenic particles. children without a molecular diagnosis of fh had higher levels of tgs, apoc2, apoc3, and higher frequency of bmi and overweight/obesity, suggesting that environmental factors can be the underlying cause of their hypercholesterolem?ia. an apob/apoa1 ratio ?0.68 was identified as the best biomarker (area under the curve = 0.835) to differentiate fh from other dyslipidemias. the inclusion in clinical criteria of a higher cut-off point for ldl cholesterol or an apob/apoa1 ratio ?0.68 optimized the criteria sensitivity and specificity. the correct identification, at an early age, of all children at-risk is of great importance so that specific interventions can be implemented. apob/apoa1 can improve the identification of fh patients.	-1
fabry disease: 20 novel gla mutations in 35 families.  thirty two mutations have been found in 35 unrelated patients of european origin with fabry disease, including 8 females. twenty of the mutations are novel and comprise of 13 missense: h46y, w47g, r49p, c94s, f113s, g258r, p259r, q279h, q280h, r363h, a377d, p409a, p409t; 1 nonsense: l294x; 5 small deletions: 154delt, 520delt, 909-918del10, 1152-1153delca, 1235-1236delct and 1 splice site mutation: ivs5+2t-->c. the remaining 12 mutations have all been reported previously. all patients with deletions had the classic form of the disease but it was not possible to predict the phenotype from the missense mutations.	-1
phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in phenylketonuria patients from india: identification of novel mutations that affect pah rna.  analysis of seven indian phenylketonuria families has revealed four novel mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene; two affected consensus splice sequence and the 3' utr, respectively, while the other two were single base insertion and deletion mutations, respectively. a novel 3' splice site mutation c.168-2a>g resulted in the activation of a cryptic 3' splice site that generated a premature termination codon leading to very low levels of the mutant transcript, probably due to activation of the nonsense-mediated decay (nmd) pathway. this is probably the first report of pku caused by the activation of nmd.	-1
mutation analysis of pah gene in patients with pku in western iran and its association with polymorphisms: identification of four novel mutations.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. untreated pku can lead to mental retardation, seizures, and other serious medical problems. this study was designed to investigate the status of molecular defects in the pah gene and their association with polymorphisms in kurdish patients with pku in the kermanshah province, western iran. the study was conducted on 27 unrelated patients with pku over a 2-year period (from 2010 to 2012). all 13 exons plus exon-intron boundaries of the pah gene were analyzed and we identified 15 different mutations, including two novel mutations, in 51 of the 54 mutant alleles (diagnostic efficiency of 94.4 %). ivs4 + 1g > c (c.441 + 1g > c) and ivs7 - 5 t > c (c.843 - 5 t > c) are novel mutations that have not been reported in the academic literature or the pah locus database ( http://www.pahdb.mcgill.ca ); therefore, they may be specific to the kurdish population. ivs2 + 5g > c and ivs9 + 5g > a were the two most prevalent mutations in our sample, with frequencies of 26 % and 17 %, respectively. the second most common mutations were p.r261x, ivs10 - 11g > a, p.k363 > nfs and ivs7 - 5 t > c, with each showing a relative frequency of 7.4 %. all other detected mutations, including p.f55 > lfs, p.r176x, p.r243q, p.v230i, p.r243x, p.r261q, ivs8 - 7a > g and p.e390g had frequencies of less than 4 %. the present study showed that there is a distinct difference in the characteristics of pah mutations between the kermanshah province and other parts of iran, suggesting that kermanshah may have a unique population distribution of pah gene mutations. iran lies on the route of major ancient movements of the caucasian people toward the mediterranean basin, and kermanshah has previously been called the gateway to asia. most of the mutations identified in this study are common in the mediterranean region. therefore, our findings are consistent with the historical and geographical links between the iranian population and the populations of mediterranean region.	-1
"distinguishing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-associated mutations from background genetic noise.  despite the significant progress that has been made in identifying disease-associated mutations, the utility of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) genetic test is limited by a lack of understanding of the background genetic variation inherent to these sarcomeric genes in seemingly healthy subjects. this study represents the first comprehensive analysis of genetic variation in 427 ostensibly healthy individuals for the hcm genetic test using the ""gold standard"" sanger sequencing method validating the background rate identified in the publically available exomes. while mutations are clearly overrepresented in disease, a background rate as high as ?5 % among healthy individuals prevents diagnostic certainty. to this end, we have identified a number of estimated predictive value-based associations including gene-specific, topology, and conservation methods generating an algorithm aiding in the probabilistic interpretation of an hcm genetic test."	-1
[juvenile pompe disease: retrospective clinical study].  pompe disease or glycogen storage disease type ii is an autosomal recessive disorder due to acid maltase deficiency. it is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/40.000 in the dutch and african-american populations and 1/46000 in the australian population. there are three forms of clinical presentation (infantile-onset, childhood-onset and adult-onset), although the disease presents as a continuum of clinical phenotypes. enzyme replacement therapy is available in portugal since 2006. the clinical files of four patients (two sisters) were analyzed retrospectively. in all, disease presented in the second year of life and the time to diagnosis ranged from two to eleven years. at diagnosis, all presented myopathic features with a delay in motor skills achievement and two had myocardium hypertrophy. clinical suspicion arose as the result of respiratory failure during infection in two patients. plasma creatine kinase and aminotransferases levels were increased in all. all patients progressed to pulmonary restrictive syndrome with chronic respiratory failure. the diagnosis was based on reduced activity of acid maltase in fibroblasts: 0 to 1.5% of the lower normal value. muscle biopsy, performed in three patients, showed lysosomal glycogen accumulation. a c.1064t > c mutation in exon 6 of gaa (glucosidase-alpha-acid) gene was found in all patients, in homozygosity in one. in the sisters, it was associated to c.1666a > g and c.2065g > a mutations in exons 12 and 15, respectively and in the youngest patient, to c.380g > t mutation in exon 2. all patients started enzyme replacement therapy as soon as it became available, with good tolerance. the youngest patient died. the surviving patients maintain ventilatory support measures and physiotherapy. the oldest patient is wheelchair ridden and her sister keeps independent walking. the youngest uses a walking aid. our cases are clinically included in the juvenile form of pompe disease. pompe disease should be suspected in progressive myopathies at any age, especially those involving limb-girdle and respiratory muscles and in small infants with cardiomyopathy. high creatine kinase is a sensitive, although nonspecific, marker. given the great variability of the genetic findings, demonstration of reduced activity of acid maltase (in leukocytes or other tissues) remains the diagnosis cornerstone of this rare disorder.	-1
runx1, but not its familial platelet disorder mutants, synergistically activates pf4 gene expression in combination with ets family proteins.  familial platelet disorder (fpd) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by thrombocytopenia and abnormal platelet function. causal mutations have been identified in the gene encoding runt-related transcription factor 1 (runx1) of fpd patients. to elucidate the role of runx1 in the regulation of expression of platelet factor 4 (pf4) and to propose a plausible mechanism underlying runx1-mediated induction of the fpd phenotype. we assessed whether runx1 and its mutants, in combination with e26 transformation-specific-1 (ets-1), core-binding factor subunit beta (cbf?), and friend leukemia virus integration 1 (fli-1), cooperatively regulate pf4 expression during megakaryocytic differentiation. in an embryonic stem cell differentiation system, expression levels of endogenous and exogenous runx1 and pf4 were determined by real-time rt-pcr. promoter activation by the transcription factors were evaluated by reporter gene assays with hepg2 cells. dna binding activity and protein interaction were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunoprecipitation assay with cos-7 cells, respectively. protein localization was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and western blotting with cos-7 cells. we demonstrated that runx1 activates endogenous pf4 expression in megakaryocytic differentiation. runx1, but not its mutants, in combination with ets-1 and cbf?, or fli-1, synergistically activated the pf4 promoter. each runx1 mutant harbors various functional abnormalities, including loss of dna-binding activity, abnormal subcellular localization, and/or alterations of binding affinities for ets-1, cbf?, and fli-1. runx1, but not its mutants, strongly and synergistically activates pf4 expression along with ets family proteins. furthermore, loss of the runx1 transcriptional activation function is induced by various functional abnormalities.	1
functional defects in six ryanodine receptor isoform-1 (ryr1) mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia and their impact on skeletal excitation-contraction coupling.  malignant hyperthermia (mh) is a potentially fatal pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that segregates with >60 mutations within the mhs-1 locus on chromosome 19 coding for ryanodine receptor type 1 (ryr1). although some mhryr1s have been shown to enhance sensitivity to caffeine and halothane when expressed in non-muscle cells, their influence on ec coupling can only be studied in skeletal myotubes. we therefore expressed wtryr1, six of the most common human mhryr1s (r163c, g341r, r614c, r2163c, v2168m, and r2458h), and a newly identified c-terminal mutation (t4826i) in dyspedic myotubes to study their functional defects and how they influence ec coupling. myotubes expressing any mhryr1 were significantly more sensitive to stimulation by caffeine and 4-cmc than those expressing wtryr1. the hypersensitivity of mh myotubes extended to k+ depolarization. mh myotubes responded to direct channel activators with maximum ca2+ amplitudes consistently smaller than wt myotubes, whereas the amplitude of their responses to depolarization were consistently larger than wt myotubes. the magnitudes of responses attainable from myotubes expressing mhryr1s are therefore related to the nature of the stimulus rather than size of the ca2+ store. the functional changes of mhryr1s were directly analyzed using [3h]ryanodine binding analysis of isolated myotube membranes. although none of the mhryr1s examined significantly altered ec50 for ca2+ activation, many failed to be completely inhibited by a low ca2+ (<or=100 nm), and all were significantly more responsive to caffeine than wtryr1 at ca2+ concentrations that approximate those in resting myotubes. all seven mutations had diminished sensitivity to inhibition by ca2+ and mg2+. using a homologous expression system, our study demonstrates for the first time that these 7 mh mutations are all both necessary and sufficient to induce mh-related phenotypes. decreased sensitivity to ca2+ and mg2+ inhibition and inability of mhryr1s to be fully inactivated at [ca2+]i typical of normal myotubes at rest are key defects that contribute to the initiation of mh episodes.	1
usher syndrome: an effective sequencing approach to establish a genetic and clinical diagnosis.  usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa, sensorineural hearing loss and, in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. the disorder is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and, to date, mutations in 11 genes have been described. this finding makes difficult to get a precise molecular diagnosis and offer patients accurate genetic counselling. to overcome this problem and to increase our knowledge of the molecular basis of usher syndrome, we designed a targeted resequencing custom panel. in a first validation step a series of 16 italian patients with known molecular diagnosis were analysed and 31 out of 32 alleles were detected (97% of accuracy). after this step, 31 patients without a molecular diagnosis were enrolled in the study. three out of them with an uncertain usher diagnosis were excluded. one causative allele was detected in 24 out 28 patients (86%) while the presence of both causative alleles characterized 19 patients out 28 (68%). sixteen novel and 27 known alleles were found in the following genes: ush2a (50%), myo7a (7%), cdh23 (11%), pcdh15 (7%) and ush1g (2%). overall, on the 44 patients the protocol was able to characterize 74 alleles out of 88 (84%). these results suggest that our panel is an effective approach for the genetic diagnosis of usher syndrome leading to: 1) an accurate molecular diagnosis, 2) better genetic counselling, 3) more precise molecular epidemiology data fundamental for future interventional plans.	-1
newborn screening for six lysosomal storage disorders in a cohort of mexican patients: three-year findings from a screening program in a closed mexican health system.  to evaluate the results of a lysosomal newborn screening (nbs) program in a cohort of 20,018 mexican patients over the course of 3years in a closed mexican health system (petrleos mexicanos [pemex] health services). using dried blood spots (dbs), we performed a multiplex tandem mass spectrometry enzymatic assay for six lysosomal storage disorders (lsds) including pompe disease, fabry disease, gaucher disease, mucopolysaccharidosis type i (mps-i), niemann-pick type a/b, and krabbe disease. screen-positive cases were confirmed using leukocyte enzymatic activity and dna molecular analysis. from july 2012 to april 2016, 20,018 patients were screened; 20 patients were confirmed to have an lsd phenotype (99.9 in 100,000 newborns). final distributions include 11 pompe disease, five fabry disease, two mps-i, and two niemann-pick type a/b patients. we did not find any gaucher or krabbe patients. a final frequency of 1 in 1001 lsd newborn phenotypes was established. nbs is a major public health achievement that has decreased the morbidity and mortality of inborn errors of metabolism. the introduction of nbs for lsd presents new challenges. this is the first multiplex latin-american study of six lsds detected through nbs.	-1
noonan syndrome caused by germline kras mutation in taiwan: report of two patients and a review of the literature.  noonan syndrome is a highly variable disorder that has significant phenotypic overlap with costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome. kras mutation was the second reported gene for noonan syndrome. this study screened for mutation of the kras gene in 57 unrelated ethnic chinese children suffering from noonan syndrome without ptpn11 gene mutation in taiwan. this work only identified two patients with different missense mutations (c.40g>a, p.val14ile; c.108a>g, p.ile36met) in the exon 1 of kras gene. this study also analyzed the characteristics of 34 reported cases involving kras mutations in the literature. all these patients presented with variable phenotypes, including noonan syndrome (n = 19), cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (n = 7), costello syndrome (n = 6), and noonan/cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (n = 1). the phenotype of kras mutations was generally severe, including short stature, mental retardation, heart defects, etc. in conclusion, this investigation demonstrates that kras mutations are the cause in a minority of cases of chinese patients with noonan syndrome in taiwan.	-1
polygenic versus monogenic causes of hypercholesterolemia ascertained clinically.  next-generation sequencing technology is transforming our understanding of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, including revision of prevalence estimates and attribution of polygenic effects. here, we examined the contributions of monogenic and polygenic factors in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia referred to a specialty clinic. we applied targeted next-generation sequencing with custom annotation, coupled with evaluation of large-scale copy number variation and polygenic scores for raised low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a cohort of 313 individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia, defined as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >5.0 mmol/l (>194 mg/dl). we found that (1) monogenic familial hypercholesterolemia-causing mutations detected by targeted next-generation sequencing were present in 47.3% of individuals; (2) the percentage of individuals with monogenic mutations increased to 53.7% when copy number variations were included; (3) the percentage further increased to 67.1% when individuals with extreme polygenic scores were included; and (4) the percentage of individuals with an identified genetic component increased from 57.0% to 92.0% as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased from 5.0 to >8.0 mmol/l (194 to >310 mg/dl). in a clinically ascertained sample with severe hypercholesterolemia, we found that most patients had a discrete genetic basis detected using a comprehensive screening approach that includes targeted next-generation sequencing, an assay for copy number variations, and polygenic trait scores.	-1
mutation and haplotype analysis of phenylalanine hydroxylase alleles in classical pku patients from the czech republic: identification of four novel mutations.  mutations, haplotypes, and other polymorphic markers in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene were analysed in 133 unrelated czech families with classical phenylketonuria (pku). almost 95% of all mutant alleles were identified, using a combination of pcr and restriction analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and sequencing. a total of 30 different mutations, 16 various rflp/vntr haplotypes, and four polymorphisms were detected on 266 independent mutant chromosomes. the most common molecular defect observed in the czech population was r408w (54.9%). each of the other 29 mutations was present in no more than 5% of alleles and 13 mutations were found in only one pku allele each (0.4%). four novel mutations g239a, r270fsdel5bp, a342p, and ivs11nt-8g-->a were identified. in 14 (5.1%) alleles, linked to four different rflp/vntr haplotypes, the sequence alterations still remain unknown. our results confirm that pku is a heterogeneous disorder at the molecular level. since there is evidence for the gene flow coming from northern, western, and southern parts of europe into our slavic population, it is clear that human migration has been the most important factor in the spread of pku alleles in europe.	-1
predicting pten mutations: an evaluation of cowden syndrome and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome clinical features.  cowden syndrome (cs) is associated with benign hamartomatous lesions and risks for thyroid, breast and endometrial cancers. bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome is an allelic disorder characterised by macrocephaly, intestinal polyps, lipomas, and pigmented penile macules. diagnostic criteria for cs are based on the presence of a range of clinical features. however, prior data on the component clinical features have been based primarily on compilations of cases reported before development of consensus diagnostic criteria. this study sought to determine the clinical features most predictive of a mutation in the largest single cohort of patients with clinical testing for pten mutations reported to date. molecular and clinical data were reviewed on 802 patients referred for pten analysis by a single laboratory. deleterious mutations were found in 172 (21.4%) subjects. among mutation carriers significant differences from previous reports were found for the frequencies of several clinical features, including macrocephaly, uterine fibroids, benign breast disease, and endometrial cancer. logistic regression analyses indicated that female mutation carriers were best identified by the presence of macrocephaly, endometrial cancer, trichilemmomas, papillomatous papules, breast cancer, benign thyroid disease, and benign gastrointestinal (gi) lesions. for males, the most discriminating features were macrocephaly, lipomas, papillomatous papules, penile freckling, benign gi lesions, and benign thyroid disease. age related differences were also identified. the mutation frequency in patients meeting cs diagnostic criteria (34%) was significantly lower than previously reported, suggesting a need for reevaluation of these criteria. a mutation prediction model has been developed which can help identify patients appropriate for pten testing in clinical practice.	-1
high cumulative risks of cancer in patients with pten hamartoma tumour syndrome.  pten hamartoma tumour syndrome (phts) encompasses several clinical syndromes with germline mutations in the pten tumour suppressor gene, including cowden syndrome which is characterised by an increased risk of breast and thyroid cancers. because phts is rare, data regarding cancer risks and genotype-phenotype correlations are limited. the objective of this study was to better define cancer risks in this syndrome with respect to the type and location of pten mutations. 154 phts individuals with a deleterious germline pten mutation were recruited from the activity of the institut bergoni genetic laboratory. detailed phenotypic information was obtained for 146 of them. age and sex adjusted standardised incidence ratio (sir) calculations, cumulative cancer risk estimations, and genotype-phenotype analyses were performed. elevated sirs were found mainly for female breast cancer (39.1, 95% ci 24.8 to 58.6), thyroid cancer in women (43.2, 95% ci 19.7 to 82.1) and in men (199.5, 95% ci 106.39 to 342.03), melanoma in women (28.3, 95% ci 7.6 to 35.4) and in men (39.4, 95% ci 10.6 to 100.9), and endometrial cancer (48.7, 95% ci 9.8 to 142.3). cumulative cancer risks at age 70 were 85% (95% ci 70% to 95%) for any cancer, 77% (95% ci 59% to 91%) for female breast cancer, and 38% (95% ci 25% to 56%) for thyroid cancer. the risk of cancer was two times greater in women with phts than in men with phts (p<0.05). this study shows a considerably high cumulative risk of cancer for patients with phts, mainly in women without clear genotype-phenotype correlation for this cancer risk. new recommendations for the management of phts patients are proposed.	-1
molecular analysis of the pds gene in pendred syndrome.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the association between sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid swelling or goitre and is likely to be the most common form of syndromic deafness. within the thyroid gland of affected individuals, iodide is incompletely organified with variable effects upon thyroid hormone biosynthesis, whilst the molecular basis of the hearing loss is unknown. the pds gene has been identified by positional cloning of chromosome 7q31, within the pendred syndrome critical linkage interval and encodes for a putative ion transporter called pendrin. we have investigated a cohort of 56 kindreds, all with features suggestive of a diagnosis of pendred syndrome. molecular analysis of the pds gene identified 47 of the 60 (78%) mutant alleles in 31 families (includes three homozygous consanguineous kindreds and one extended family segregating three mutant alleles). moreover, four recurrent mutations accounted for 35 (74%) of pds disease chromosomes detected and haplotype analysis would favour common founders rather than mutational hotspots within the pds gene. whilst these findings demonstrate molecular heterogeneity for pds mutations associated with pendred syndrome, this study would support the use of molecular analysis of the pds gene in the assessment of families with congenital hearing loss.	-1
a silent mutation induces exon skipping in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in phenylketonuria.  an a-->t substitution in cdna nucleotide 1197 (c.1197a/t) of the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene has been regarded as a silent mutation, because both the wild-type (gua) and the mutant (guu) alleles encode a valine residue at codon 399 (v399 v). the nucleotide c.1197 is located at the 3'-end of exon 11at position -3 of the exon-intron junction. to explore whether the substitution exerts any effects on the processing of the pah mrna, illegitimate pah transcripts from lymphoblast cultures of a phenylketonuria (pku) patient heterozygous for c.1197a/t were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction following reverse-transcription (rt-pcr). mrnas with an exon 11 deletion were revealed. furthermore, by using an r408 w mutation in the paternal allele as a marker, sequence analysis of the rt-pcr products indicates that virtually all pah transcripts from the maternal allele with the c. 1197a/t substitution do not contain exon 11. to address whether this substitution is the main determinant for exon skipping, pah minigenes with or without the substitution were constructed and transfected to a human hepatoma cell line. analysis of the transcription products by s1 nuclease mapping clearly indicated that such exon 11 skipping was directly associated with the c.1197a/t substitution. thus, this study demonstrates that the c.1197a/t substitution in the pah gene is not just a neutral polymorphism but a mutation that induces post-transcriptional skipping of exon 11 leading to a pku phenotype.	1
a human mybpc3 mutation appearing about 10 centuries ago results in a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with delayed onset, moderate evolution but with a risk of sudden death.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a genetically heterogeneous disease. one specific mutation in the mybpc3 gene is highly prevalent in center east of france giving an opportunity to define the clinical profile of this specific mutation. hcm probands were screened for mutation in the myh7, mybpc3, tnnt2 and tnni3 genes. carriers of the mybpc3 ivs20-2a>g mutation were genotyped with 8 microsatellites flanking this gene. the age of this mybpc3 mutation was inferred with the software estiage. the age at first symptom, diagnosis, first complication, first severe complication and the rate of sudden death were compared between carriers of the ivs20-2 mutation (group a) and carriers of all other mutations (group b) using time to event curves and log rank test. out of 107 hcm probands, 45 had a single heterozygous mutation in one of the 4 tested sarcomeric genes including 9 patients with the mybpc3 ivs20-2a>g mutation. the ivs20-2 mutation in these 9 patients and their 25 mutation carrier relatives was embedded in a common haplotype defined after genotyping 4 polymorphic markers on each side of the mybpc3 gene. this result supports the hypothesis of a common ancestor. furthermore, we evaluated that the mutation occurred about 47 generations ago, approximately at the 10th century.we then compared the clinical profile of the ivs20-2 mutation carriers (group a) and the carriers of all other mutations (group b). age at onset of symptoms was similar in the 34 group a cases and the 73 group b cases but group a cases were diagnosed on average 15 years later (log rank test p = 0.022). age of first complication and first severe complication was delayed in group a vs group b cases but the prevalence of sudden death and age at death was similar in both groups. a founder mutation arising at about the 10th century in the mybpc3 gene accounts for 8.4% of all hcm in center east france and results in a cardiomyopathy starting late and evolving slowly but with an apparent risk of sudden death similar to other sarcomeric mutations.	-1
molecular and functional characterization of a human frataxin mutation found in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated with marked genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. pathogenic mutations in the 10 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-associated sarcomeric genes cause autosomal dominant disease as a rule, although recessive disease has been reported. cardiac hypertrophy is also a hallmark of friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. we hypothesized that heterozygous mutations in frataxin may mimic or modify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. using dhplc and dna sequencing, we identified the novel r40c-frataxin mutation in a patient who also harbored a previously reported r810h-myosin binding protein c mutation. the r810h mutation is reported to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy only in the setting of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with another sarcomeric mutation. site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro and in vivo analysis enabled functional characterization of the mutant frataxin protein. r40c-frataxin protein is not cleaved to the mature form in vitro and shows delayed kinetics of cleavage by isolated mouse mitochondria. yeast cells expressing r40c-frataxin demonstrated increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and abnormal accumulation of precursor frataxin protein. these data indicate that frataxin deficiency may have contributed to this patient's particular phenotype. furthermore, these findings suggest that mutations altering myocyte energetics may act in synergy with sarcomeric mutations to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	-1
clinical impact of the alpha-galactosidase a gene single nucleotide polymorphism -10c>t: a single-center observational study.  single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in the alpha-galactosidase a gene region (gla) have been discussed as potential cause of symptoms and organ manifestations similarly to those seen in fabry disease (fd). however, due to scarce data, clinical implications remain limited. the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical impact of -10c>t snp in the gla.prospective single-center observational study to determine the natural history and outcome of fd.subjects initially referred to the fabry center for interdisciplinary therapy wrzburg (fazit) for management of suspected fd (11 women, 2 men, mean age 42  10 years) who were tested negative for coding gla mutations but positive for the noncoding -10c>t snp underwent comprehensive characterization for therapy recommendation.all subjects reported at least 1 neurological, but no cardiac or renal symptoms. in 7 patients, pain of unknown etiology was reported and 3 patients had a history of cryptogenic stroke. in all patients, ?-gal activity was at a lower limit, ranging between 0.27 and 0.45 nmol/min per mg protein (reference: 0.4-1.0), while plasma lyso-gb3 levels remained normal (range 0.39  0.33; reference: ?0.9 ng/ml). for both hemizygous subjects investigated, brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed unspecific white matter lesions. one of these subjects had suffered from severe early-onset stroke, the other showed mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.presence of isolated heterozygous -10c >t snp is not associated with clinically relevant symptoms or organ manifestations as seen in fd. respective polymorphisms might, however, play a role in modifying disease severity in fd. great care has to be taken in respective subjects suspected to suffer from nonclassical fd in order to prevent unnecessary fabry-specific therapy.	-1

two missense mutations causing mild hyperphenylalaninemia associated with dna haplotype 12.  the genetic defects responsible for most phenylketonuria (pku) and hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) cases are located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. approximately 50-60 mutations have been reported in caucasians and are reflected in a wide range of clinical severities. most mutations are linked to specific haplotypes, as defined by eight polymorphic restriction sites in the pah gene. we hypothesized that there is at least one mild mutation linked to haplotype 12 in the swedish pku/hpa population, since 7 of 8 patients carrying haplotype 12 had mild hpa. sequence analysis revealed a c-to-g transversion at the second base of codon 322, resulting in a substitution of glycine for alanine, in four mutant haplotype 12 genes, and a g-to-a transition at the second base of codon 408, resulting in a substitution of glutamine for arginine, in another three mutant haplotype 12 genes. these mutations segregated with mutant haplotype 12 alleles in nuclear families but were not present on normal or other mutant alleles. both mutations were tested in a eukaryotic expression system in which enzyme activities of different mutant pah enzymes reflect the relative severities of the mutations, although these in vitro activities cannot be translated directly into in vivo hepatic activities. the a322g mutant pah had about 75% and the r408q mutant pah about 55% of the wild-type pah enzyme activity. these in vitro activities are the highest reported for mutant pah enzymes produced in the same expression system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)	1
targeted dna sequencing from autism spectrum disorder brains implicates multiple genetic mechanisms.  single nucleotide variants (snvs), particularly loss-of-function mutations, are significant contributors to autism spectrum disorder (asd) risk. here we report the first systematic deep sequencing study of 55 postmortem asd brains for snvs in 78 known asd candidate genes. remarkably, even without parental samples, we find more asd brains with mutations that are protein-altering (26/55 cases versus 12/50 controls, p = 0.015), deleterious (16/55 versus 5/50, p = 0.016), or loss-of-function (6/55 versus 0/50, p = 0.028) compared to controls, with recurrent deleterious mutations in arid1b, scn1a, scn2a, and setd2, suggesting these mutations contribute to asd risk. in several cases, the identified mutations and medical records suggest syndromic asd diagnoses. two asd and one fragile x premutation case showed deleterious somatic mutations, providing evidence that somatic mutations occur in asd cases, and supporting a model in which a combination of germline and/or somatic mutations may contribute to asd risk on a case-by-case basis.	-1

rare variants in the epithelial cadherin gene underlying the genetic etiology of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate.  nonsyndromic orofacial cleft (nsofc) is a complex disease of still unclear genetic etiology. to investigate the contribution of rare epithelial cadherin (cdh1) gene variants to nsofc, we target sequenced 221 probands. candidate variants were evaluated via in vitro, in silico, or segregation analyses. three probably pathogenic variants (c.760g>a [p.asp254asn], c.1023t>g [p.tyr341*], and c.2351g>a [p.arg784his]) segregated according to autosomal dominant inheritance in four nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nscl/p) families (lod score: 5.8 at ? = 0; 47% penetrance). a fourth possibly pathogenic variant (c.387+5g>a) was also found, but further functional analyses are needed (overall prevalence of cdh1 candidate variants: 2%; 15.4% among familial cases). cdh1 mutational burden was higher among probands from familial cases when compared to that of controls (p = 0.002). we concluded that cdh1 contributes to nscl/p with mainly rare, moderately penetrant variants, and cdh1 haploinsufficiency is the likely etiological mechanism.	-1
abnormal cardiac formation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: fractal analysis of trabeculae and preclinical gene expression.  mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. subtle abnormalities of the myocardium may be present in mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy (g+lvh-) but are difficult to quantify. fractal analysis has been used to define trabeculae in left ventricular noncompaction and to identify normal racial variations. we hypothesized that trabeculae measured by fractal analysis of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images are abnormal in g+lvh- patients, providing a preclinical marker of disease in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed on 40 g+lvh- patients (3315 years, 38% men), 67 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5315 years, 76% men; 31 with a pathogenic mutation [g+lvh+]), and 69 matched healthy volunteers (4415 years, 57% men). trabeculae were quantified by fractal analysis of cine slices to calculate the fractal dimension, a unitless index of endocardial complexity calculated from endocardial contours after segmentation. in g+lvh- patients, apical left ventricular trabeculation was increased compared with controls (maximal apical fractal dimension, 1.2490.07 versus 1.1990.05; p=0.001). in g+lvh+ and g-lvh+ cohorts, maximal apical fractal dimension was greater than in controls (p<0.0001) irrespective of gene status (g+lvh+: 1.3700.08; g-lvh+: 1.3800.09). compared with controls, g+lvh- patients also had a higher frequency of clefts (28% versus 8%; p=0.02), longer anterior mitral valve leaflets (23.53.0 versus 19.73.1 mm; p<0.0001), greater septal systolic wall thickness (12.63.2 versus 11.22.1 mm; p=0.03), higher ejection fraction (714% versus 694%; p=0.03), and smaller end-systolic volumes (389 versus 4312 ml; p=0.03). increased myocardial trabecular complexity is one of several preclinical abnormalities in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sarcomere gene mutation carriers without lvh.	-1
pdzd7 is a modifier of retinal disease and a contributor to digenic usher syndrome.  usher syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disease characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa (rp). it frequently presents with unexplained, often intrafamilial, variability of the visual phenotype. although 9 genes have been linked with usher syndrome, many patients do not have mutations in any of these genes, suggesting that there are still unidentified genes involved in the syndrome. here, we have determined that mutations in pdz domain-containing 7 (pdzd7), which encodes a homolog of proteins mutated in usher syndrome subtype 1c (ush1c) and ush2d, contribute to usher syndrome. mutations in pdzd7 were identified only in patients with mutations in other known usher genes. in a set of sisters, each with a homozygous mutation in ush2a, a frame-shift mutation in pdzd7 was present in the sister with more severe rp and earlier disease onset. further, heterozygous pdzd7 mutations were present in patients with truncating mutations in ush2a, g protein-coupled receptor 98 (gpr98; also known as ush2c), and an unidentified locus. we validated the human genotypes using zebrafish, and our findings were consistent with digenic inheritance of pdzd7 and gpr98, and with pdzd7 as a retinal disease modifier in patients with ush2a. pdzd7 knockdown produced an usher-like phenotype in zebrafish, exacerbated retinal cell death in combination with ush2a or gpr98, and reduced gpr98 localization in the region of the photoreceptor connecting cilium. our data challenge the view of usher syndrome as a traditional mendelian disorder and support the reclassification of usher syndrome as an oligogenic disease.	-1
molecular analysis of phenylketonuria in denmark: 99% of the mutations detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.  we present the results of a comprehensive study on the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (pku) in denmark. a strategy relying on pcr in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis for analyzing the coding sequence and splice site junctions of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene allowed us to detect a molecular defect on 99% of 308 danish pku chromosomes. the mutational spectrum consists of 35 different mutations, including 23 missense mutations, 5 splice mutations, 4 nonsense mutations, and 3 deletions. seventeen of these mutations have not been reported previously. the mutation detection assay presented in this report offers a simple and reliable methodological entity that can be applied to rapid diagnosis and carrier detection of phenylketonuria in any population, irrespective of the frequency and distribution of mutations.	-1

paternal origin of fgfr3 mutations in muenke-type craniosynostosis.  muenke syndrome, also known as fgfr3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749c>g, encoding the amino acid substitution pro250arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (fgfr3). this frequently occurs as a new mutation, manifesting one of the highest documented rates for any transversion in the human genome. to understand the biology of this mutation, we have investigated its parental origin, and the ages of the parents, in 19 families with de novo c.749c>g mutations. all ten informative cases originated from the paternal allele (95% confidence interval 74-100% paternal); the average paternal age at birth overall was 34.7 years. an exclusive paternal origin of mutations, and increased paternal age, were previously described for a different mutation (c.1138g>a) of the fgfr3 gene causing achondroplasia, as well as for mutations of the related fgfr2 gene causing apert, crouzon and pfeiffer syndromes. we conclude that similar biological processes are likely to shape the occurrence of this c.749c>g mutation as for other mutations of fgfr3 as well as fgfr2.	-1
whole-exome sequencing identifies ush2a mutations in a pseudo-dominant usher syndrome family.  usher syndrome (ush) is an autosomal recessive (ar) multi-sensory degenerative disorder leading to deaf-blindness. ush is clinically subdivided into three subclasses, and 10 genes have been identified thus far. clinical and genetic heterogeneities in ush make a precise diagnosis difficult. a dominant-like ush family in successive generations was identified, and the present study aimed to determine the genetic predisposition of this family. whole-exome sequencing was performed in two affected patients and an unaffected relative. systematic data were analyzed by bioinformatic analysis to remove the candidate mutations via step-wise filtering. direct sanger sequencing and co-segregation analysis were performed in the pedigree. one novel and two known mutations in the ush2a gene were identified, and were further confirmed by direct sequencing and co-segregation analysis. the affected mother carried compound mutations in the ush2a gene, while the unaffected father carried a heterozygous mutation. the present study demonstrates that whole-exome sequencing is a robust approach for the molecular diagnosis of disorders with high levels of genetic heterogeneity.	-1
severe cardiac conduction disturbances and pacemaker implantation in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of severe cardiac conduction disturbances in a cohort of 451 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and to describe the characteristics of, and outcomes in, those who required a permanent pacemaker. a pacemaker was implanted in 48 patients (11%): 20 had sinus node dysfunction and 28 had an atrioventricular conduction disturbance. primary bradyarrhythmia (which was not related to iatrogenic atrioventricular block or therapeutic ablation of the atrioventricular node) was the reason for permanent pacemaker implantation in 36 patients (8%). in 18% of cases, at least one other family member had a permanent pacemaker. in this patient series, a high prevalence of severe cardiac conduction disturbance leading to permanent pacemaker implantation was observed. severe cardiac conduction disturbance in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may also have a familial component.	-1
mutational spectrum of phenylketonuria in jiangsu province.  phenylketonuria (pku) is caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. we systematically investigated all 13 exons of the pah gene and their flanking introns in 31 unrelated patients and their parents using next-generation sequencing (ngs). a total of 33 different variants were identified in 58 of 62 mutant pah alleles. the prevalent variants with a relative frequency of 5 % or more were c.721c > t, c.1068c > a, c.611a > g, c.1197a > t, c.728g > a, c.331c > t, and c.442-1g > a. one novel variant was identified in this study-c.699c > g. we studied genotype-phenotype correlations using the guldberg arbitrary value (av) system, which revealed a consistency rate of 38 % (8/21) among the 21 predicted phenotypes. the genotype-based prediction of bh4 responsiveness was also evaluated, and 14 patients (45.2 %) were predicted to be bh4 responsive. this study presents the spectrum of pah variants in jiangsu province. the information obtained from the genotype-based prediction of bh4 responsiveness might be used for the rational selection of candidates for bh4 testing.  phenylketonuria (pku) is caused by variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene.  the spectrum of pah variants in different chinese populations has been reported. what is new:  this is the first report on the spectrum of pah variants in jiangsu province.  this study identified one novel pah variant-c.699c>g-and and tries to show a genotype-phenotype relationship also regarding bh4-responsiveness.	-1
mapping pathogenic mutations suggests an innovative structural model for the pendrin (slc26a4) transmembrane domain.  human pendrin (slc26a4) is an anion transporter mostly expressed in the inner ear, thyroid and kidney. slc26a4 gene mutations are associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum, including pendred syndrome and non-syndromic hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (ns-eva). no experimental structure of pendrin is currently available, making phenotype-genotype correlations difficult as predictions of transmembrane (tm) segments vary in number. here, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3d) pendrin transmembrane domain model based on the slc26dg transporter. the resulting 14 tm topology was found to include two non-canonical transmembrane segments crucial for pendrin activity. mutation mapping of 147 clinically validated pathological mutations shows that most affect two previously undescribed tm regions.	1
a global suppressor motif for p53 cancer mutants.  the transcription factor and tumor suppressor protein p53 is frequently inactivated in human cancers. in many cases, p53 gene mutations result in high levels of inactive, full-length p53 protein with one amino acid change in the core domain that recognizes p53 dna-binding sites. the ability to endow function to mutated p53 proteins would dramatically improve cancer therapy, because it would reactivate a central apoptotic pathway. by using genetic strategies and p53 assays in yeast and mammalian cells, we identified a global suppressor motif involving codons 235, 239, and 240. these intragenic suppressor mutations, either alone or in combination, restored function to 16 of 30 of the most common p53 cancer mutants tested. the 235-239-240 suppressor motif establishes that manipulation of a small region of the core domain is sufficient to activate a large number of p53 cancer mutants. understanding the structural basis of the rescue mechanism will allow the pursuit of small compounds able to achieve a similar stabilization of p53 cancer mutants.	1
a mutant cardiac sodium channel with multiple biophysical defects associated with overlapping clinical features of brugada syndrome and cardiac conduction disease.  loss of na(+) channel function has been implicated in idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (ivf) and brugada syndrome. we have studied the biophysical properties of an ivf mutation (s1710l) that exhibited an unusual clinical phenotype: rate-dependent bundle branch block without manifestation of brugada-type ecg pattern. the mutant s1710l channels were expressed in mammalian cells and their gating properties, studied using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, were compared with wild-type (wt) and a brugada syndrome mutant channel t1620m. the s1710l channel exhibited significantly faster macroscopic current decay than wt or t1620m. in addition, s1710l showed a negative shift in the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation and slower recovery from fast inactivation than in wt or t1620m. in addition to the alterations in fast inactivation most commonly observed in brugada syndrome mutations, s1710l exhibited marked enhancement in slow inactivation and a large positive shift of activation that potentially decreases conduction velocity. these functional abnormalities may be responsible for the overlapping clinical phenotypes associated with brugada syndrome and the cardiac conduction defect, a novel cardiac na(+) channelopathy.	1
mutational screening of the ush2a gene in spanish ush patients reveals 23 novel pathogenic mutations.  usher syndrome type ii (ush2) is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by moderate to severe hearing impairment and retinitis pigmentosa (rp). among the three genes implicated, mutations in the ush2a gene account for 74-90% of the ush2 cases. to identify the genetic cause of the disease and determine the frequency of ush2a mutations in a cohort of 88 unrelated ush spanish patients, we carried out a mutation screening of the 72 coding exons of this gene by direct sequencing. moreover, we performed functional minigene studies for those changes that were predicted to affect splicing. as a result, a total of 144 dna sequence variants were identified. based upon previous studies, allele frequencies, segregation analysis, bioinformatics' predictions and in vitro experiments, 37 variants (23 of them novel) were classified as pathogenic mutations. this report provide a wide spectrum of ush2a mutations and clinical features, including atypical usher syndrome phenotypes resembling usher syndrome type i. considering only the patients clearly diagnosed with usher syndrome type ii, and results obtained in this and previous studies, we can state that mutations in ush2a are responsible for 76.1% of ush2 disease in patients of spanish origin.	1
a unique point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (fgfr3) defines a new craniosynostosis syndrome.  the underlying basis of many forms of syndromic craniosynostosis has been defined on a molecular level. however, many patients with familial or sporadic craniosynostosis do not have the classical findings of those craniosynostosis syndromes. here we present 61 individuals from 20 unrelated families where coronal synostosis is due to an amino acid substitution (pro250arg) that results from a single point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene on chromosome 4p. in this instance, a new clinical syndrome is being defined on the basis of the molecular finding. in addition to the skull findings, some patients had abnormalities on radiographs of hands and feet, including thimble-like middle phalanges, coned epiphyses, and carpal and tarsal fusions. brachydactyly was seen in some cases; none had clinically significant syndactyly or deviation of the great toe. sensorineural hearing loss was present in some, and developmental delay was seen in a minority. while the radiological findings of hands and feet can be very helpful in diagnosing this syndrome, it is not in all cases clearly distinguishable on a clinical basis from other craniosynostosis syndromes. therefore, this mutation should be tested for in patients with coronal synostosis.	-1
deletion of exon 18 is a frequent mutation in glycogen storage disease type ii.  an abnormal 2.3 kb saci fragment of the human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene (gaa) was identified in patients with glycogen storage disease type ii. the fragment results from deletion of exon 18 and adjacent parts of intron 17 and 18. the borders of the deletion are marked by the occurrence of an eight nucleotide long tandem repeat (aggggccg) which is apparently instrumental in the mutation event. the exon 18 deletion was demonstrated in 10 out of 39 patients from europe (all hetero-allelic) and is so far the most common mutation in this disease (allele frequency among patients is 0.13).	-1
germline gain-of-function mutations in raf1 cause noonan syndrome.  noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphia and a wide spectrum of congenital heart defects. mutations of ptpn11, kras and sos1 in the ras-mapk pathway cause approximately 60% of cases of noonan syndrome. however, the gene(s) responsible for the remainder are unknown. we have identified five different mutations in raf1 in ten individuals with noonan syndrome; those with any of four mutations causing changes in the cr2 domain of raf1 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), whereas affected individuals with mutations leading to changes in the cr3 domain did not. cells transfected with constructs containing noonan syndrome-associated raf1 mutations showed increased in vitro kinase and erk activation, and zebrafish embryos with morpholino knockdown of raf1 demonstrated the need for raf1 for the development of normal myocardial structure and function. thus, our findings implicate raf1 gain-of-function mutations as a causative agent of a human developmental disorder, representing a new genetic mechanism for the activation of the mapk pathway.	1
targeted screening of fabry disease in male hemodialysis patients in brazil highlights importance of family screening.  fabry disease (fd) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by enzyme ? galactosidase a (?-gal a) deficiency due to mutations in the galactosidase alpha (gla) gene. it leads to damage several organs, such as the kidneys, due to progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids. to estimate the prevalence of fd among male hemodialysis (hd) patients in a northern state of brazil. screening was performed using a dried blood spot on filter paper to identify patients with low ?-gal a enzyme activity (?2.2 mol/l/h). those with low enzyme activity underwent genetic analysis of the gla gene. family screening was conducted in the index cases. 2,583 male hd patients (age: 52 (18-91 years)) were screened. the ?-gal a assay identified 72 males (2.78%) with low enzyme activity. genotyping identified 3 patients with gla mutations: w204x, a368t, both previously reported; and c52f, a novel missense mutation. only the patient with w204x mutation had classic fd. the prevalence rate was 0.12%. family screening of the index cases identified 23 family members with the same mutations. the prevalence of fd amongst male hd patients found in the northern of brazil was low (0.12%). however, family screening of the 3 index cases identified family members at an early stage of the disease, which may benefit from earlier treatment.	1
molecular and clinical analysis of raf1 in noonan syndrome and related disorders: dephosphorylation of serine 259 as the essential mechanism for mutant activation.  noonan syndrome (ns) and related disorders are autosomal dominant disorders characterized by heart defects, facial dysmorphism, ectodermal abnormalities, and mental retardation. the dysregulation of the ras/mapk pathway appears to be a common molecular pathogenesis of these disorders: mutations in ptpn11, kras, and sos1 have been identified in patients with ns, those in kras, braf, map2k1, and map2k2 in patients with cfc syndrome, and those in hras mutations in costello syndrome patients. recently, mutations in raf1 have been also identified in patients with ns and two patients with leopard (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome. in the current study, we identified eight raf1 mutations in 18 of 119 patients with ns and related conditions without mutations in known genes. we summarized clinical manifestations in patients with raf1 mutations as well as those in ns patients withptpn11, sos1, or kras mutations previously reported. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and short stature were found to be more frequently observed in patients with raf1 mutations. mutations in raf1 were clustered in the conserved region 2 (cr2) domain, which carries an inhibitory phosphorylation site (serine at position 259; s259). functional studies revealed that the raf1 mutants located in the cr2 domain resulted in the decreased phosphorylation of s259, and that mutant raf1 then dissociated from 14-3-3, leading to a partial erk activation. our results suggest that the dephosphorylation of s259 is the primary pathogenic mechanism in the activation of raf1 mutants located in the cr2 domain as well as of downstream erk.	1
a ptpn11 gene mutation (y63c) causing noonan syndrome is not associated with short stature in general population.  human growth is a highly complicated process, but it is obviously influenced by a genetic factor. recent genome-wide linkage analyses suggested some genetic regions underlying stature variations. however, any specific genes underlying stature variations have not been identified. noonan syndrome (ns) is an autosomal dominant disorder clinically characterized by short stature, minor facial anomalies, and congenital heart defects. recently, ptpn11 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type 11) has been identified as a major responsible gene for ns, causing about half of the affected individuals. we herein report a large family demonstrating ns caused by one of the common ptpn11 mutations, c.188 a > g (y63c). in this family, the patients were apparently healthy, but heterozygosity of the c.188 a > g (y63c) mutation was related to growth impairment. this finding suggested that ptpn11 genetic variants contribute to adult height in the general population. however, c.188 a > g (y63c) was not identified in 96 short individuals from the general population of 2,281 healthy adults. thus, it is unlikely that ptpn11 is one of the genes underlying stature variations in the general population.	-1
update of the pompe disease mutation database with 60 novel gaa sequence variants and additional studies on the functional effect of 34 previously reported variants.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder, characterized by progressive muscle weakness. deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase (ec; 3.2.1.20/3) can be caused by numerous pathogenic variants in the gaa gene. the pompe disease mutation database at http://www.pompecenter.nl aims to list all variants and their effect. this update reports on 94 variants. we examined 35 novel and 34 known mutations by site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression in cos-7 cells or hek293t cells. each of these mutations was given a severity rating using a previously published system, based on the level of acid ?-glucosidase activity in medium and transfected cells and on the quantity and quality of the different molecular mass species in the posttranslational modification and transport of acid ?-glucosidase. this approach enabled to classify 55 missense mutations as pathogenic and 13 as likely nonpathogenic. based on their nature and the use of in silico analysis (alamut software), 12 of the additional 25 novel mutations were predicted to be pathogenic including 4 splicing mutations, 6 mutations leading to frameshift, and 2 point mutations causing stop codons. seven of the additional mutations were considered nonpathogenic (4 silent and 3 occurring in intron regions), and 6 are still under investigation.	1
mutations in coch that result in non-syndromic autosomal dominant deafness (dfna9) affect matrix deposition of cochlin.  the coch gene mutated in autosomal dominant sensorineural deafness (dfna9) encodes cochlin, a major constituent of the inner ear extracellular matrix. sequence analysis of cochlin from dfna9 patients identified five distinct single-amino-acid mutations within a conserved region (the lccl domain) of cochlin. to define the molecular basis of dfna9, we have generated myc-tagged wild-type and mutant cochlins and explored their behavior in transient transfection systems. western blotting of cell lysates and culture media indicates that wild-type and mutant cochlins are synthesized and secreted in similar amounts. immunofluorescent staining confirms that all are detected within the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex of transfected cells. our findings suggest that coch mutations are unlikely to cause abnormalities in secretion and suggest that extracellular events might cause dfna9 pathology. in agreement, we show that wild-type cochlin accumulates in extracellular deposits that closely parallel the matrix component fibronectin, whereas mutant cochlins vary in the amount and pattern of extracellular material. whereas some mutants exhibit an almost normal deposition pattern, some show complete lack of deposition. our results suggest that dfna9 results from gene products that fail to integrate correctly into the extracellular matrix. the partial or complete penetrance of integration defects suggests that dfna9 pathology may be caused by multiple molecular mechanisms, including compromised ability of cochlin to self-assemble or to form appropriate complexes with other matrix components.	1
phenotypic heterogeneity in monogenic diabetes: the clinical and diagnostic utility of a gene panel-based next-generation sequencing approach.  single gene mutations that primarily affect pancreatic ?-cell function account for approximately 1-2% of all cases of diabetes. overlapping clinical features with common forms of diabetes makes diagnosis of monogenic diabetes challenging. a genetic diagnosis often leads to significant alterations in treatment, allows better prediction of disease prognosis and progression, and has implications for family members. currently, genetic testing for monogenic diabetes relies on selection of appropriate individual genes for analysis based on the availability of often-limited phenotypic information, decreasing the likelihood of making a genetic diagnosis. we thus developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (ngs) assay for the detection of mutations in 36 genes known to cause monogenic forms of diabetes, including transient or permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (tndm or pndm), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) and rare syndromic forms of diabetes. a total of 95 patient samples were analyzed: 19 with known causal mutations and 76 with a clinically suggestive phenotype but lacking a genetic diagnosis. all previously identified mutations were detected, validating our assay. pathogenic sequence changes were identified in 19 out of 76 (25%) patients: 7 of 32 (22%) ndm cases, and 12 of 44 (27%) mody cases. in 2 ndm patients the causal mutation was not expected as consanguinity was not reported and there were no clinical features aside from diabetes. a 3 year old patient with ndm diagnosed at 3 months of age, who previously tested negative for ins, kcnj11 and abcc8 mutations, was found to carry a novel homozygous mutation in eif2ak3 (associated with wolcott-rallison syndrome), a gene not previously suspected because consanguinity, delayed growth, abnormal bone development and hepatic complications had not been reported. similarly, another infant without a history of consanguinity was found to have a homozygous gck mutation causing pndm at birth. this study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-gene panel analysis in uncovering molecular diagnoses in patients with monogenic forms of diabetes.	-1
variants of uncertain significance in newborn screening disorders: implications for large-scale genomic sequencing.  as exome and genome sequencing using high-throughput sequencing technologies move rapidly into the diagnostic process, laboratories and clinicians need to develop a strategy for dealing with uncertain findings. a commitment must be made to minimize these findings, and all parties may need to make adjustments to their processes. the information required to reclassify these variants is often available but not communicated to all relevant parties. to illustrate these issues, we focused on three well-characterized monogenic, metabolic disorders included in newborn screens: classic galactosemia, caused by galt variants; phenylketonuria, caused by pah variants; and medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase (mcad) deficiency, caused by acadm variants. in 10 years of clinical molecular testing, we have observed 134 unique galt variants, 46 of which were variants of uncertain significance (vus). in pah, we observed 132 variants, including 17 vus, and for acadm, we observed 64 unique variants, of which 33 were uncertain. after this review, 17 vus (37%; 7 in acadm, 9 in galt, and 1 in pah) were reclassified from uncertain (6 to benign or likely benign and 11 to pathogenic or likely pathogenic). we identified common types of missing information that would have helped make a definitive classification and categorized this information by ease and cost to obtain.genet med 19 1, 77-82.	-1
susceptibility of glucokinase-mody mutants to inactivation by oxidative stress in pancreatic ?-cells.  the posttranslational regulation of glucokinase (gk) differs in hepatocytes and pancreatic ?-cells. we tested the hypothesis that gk mutants that cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (gk-mody) show compromised activity and posttranslational regulation in ?-cells. activity and protein expression of gk-mody and persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy (phhi) mutants were studied in ?-cell (min6) and non-?-cell (h4iie) models. binding of gk to phosphofructo-2-kinase, fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (pfk2/fbpase2) was studied by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in cell-based models. nine of 11 gk-mody mutants that have minimal effect on enzyme kinetics in vitro showed decreased specific activity relative to wild type when expressed in ?-cells. a subset of these were stable in non-?-cells but showed increased inactivation in conditions of oxidative stress and partial reversal of inactivation by dithiothreitol. unlike the gk-mody mutants, four of five gk-phhi mutants had similar specific activity to wild type and y214c had higher activity than wild type. the gk-binding protein pfk2/fbpase2 protected wild-type gk from oxidative inactivation and the decreased stability of gk-mody mutants correlated with decreased interaction with pfk2/fbpase2. several gk-mody mutants show posttranslational defects in ?-cells characterized by increased susceptibility to oxidative stress and/or protein instability. regulation of gk activity through modulation of thiol status may be a physiological regulatory mechanism for the control of gk activity in ?-cells.	1
subset of individuals with autism spectrum disorders and extreme macrocephaly associated with germline pten tumour suppressor gene mutations.  the genetic aetiology of autism remains elusive. occasionally, individuals with cowden syndrome (a cancer syndrome) and other related hamartoma disorders such as bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome, proteus syndrome, and proteus-like conditions, are characterised by germline pten mutations, and may have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. therefore, we undertook pten gene mutation analysis in 18 subjects mainly prospectively ascertained with autism spectrum disorder and macrocephaly. of these 18 autistic subjects (13 males and five females; ages 3.1-18.4 years) with a head circumference range from 2.5 to 8.0 standard deviations above the mean, three males (17%) carried germline pten mutations. these three probands had previously undescribed pten mutations: h93r (exon 4), d252g (exon 7), and f241s (exon 7). they had the larger head circumference measurements amongst all our study subjects. the three residues altered in our patients were highly evolutionarily conserved. we suggest that pten gene testing be considered for patients with autistic behaviour and extreme macrocephaly. the gene findings may impact on recurrence risks as well as medical management for the patient.	-1
molecular genetics of phenylketonuria in orientals: linkage disequilibrium between a termination mutation and haplotype 4 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  phenylketonuria (pku) is a common metabolic disorder among chinese, with a prevalence of about 1 in 16,500 births. this frequency is very similar to that among caucasians. individual exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene with flanking introns were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into m13 for sequence analysis. an arg111-to-ter111 mutation has been identified in exon 3 of the pah gene in a chinese pku patient. the mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with the mutant haplotype 4 alleles which are the most prevalent haplotype among the orientals. the mutation accounts for about 10% of the chinese pku alleles and is absent from the caucasians, demonstrating that independent mutational events have occurred in the pah locus after racial divergence.	-1
in vitro expression of 34 naturally occurring mutant variants of phenylalanine hydroxylase: correlation with metabolic phenotypes and susceptibility toward protein aggregation.  phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) is a homotetrameric enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, the rate-limiting step of phenylalanine disposal in humans. primary dysfunction of pah caused by mutations in the pah gene results in hyperphenylalaninemia, which may impair cognitive development unless corrected by dietary restriction of phenylalanine. the mechanism(s) by which pah missense mutations cause enzyme impairment has been studied in detail only in a small number of cases, but existing evidence points to a major role of enhanced proteolytic degradation due to aberrant folding of mutant polypeptides. we have used two heterologous in vitro expression systems (a mammalian cell-free transcription-translation system and the pet system of escherichia coli) to examine 34 mutations that have been associated with pah deficiency in the danish population. these mutations represent a broad range of amino acid substitutions, functional enzyme domains, and metabolic phenotypes. in both systems, residual in vitro activities correlated broadly with metabolic phenotypes, however, with significant discrepancies. analysis of e. coli extracts by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and storage experiments showed that (i) in general, mutations in the n-terminal regulatory domain are associated with relatively stable proteins compared to most mutations in the central catalytic domain, and (ii) for mutations in the catalytic domain, high levels of protein aggregation do not always correspond with a severe phenotype. our data support and extend previous evidence that pah mutations exert their pathogenic effects by several distinct mechanisms that may operate individually or in concert.	1
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. microsatellite haplotyping and identification of a hot spot for mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. the first identified disease gene, located on chromosome 14q11-q12, encodes the beta-myosin heavy chain. we have performed linkage analysis of two french fhc pedigrees, 720 and 730, with two microsatellite markers located in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (myo i and myo ii) and with four highly informative markers, recently mapped to chromosome 14q11-q12. significant linkage was found with myo i and myo ii in pedigree 720, but results were not conclusive for pedigree 730. haplotype analysis of the six markers allowed identification of affected individuals and of some unaffected subjects carrying the disease gene. two novel missense mutations were identified in exon 13 by direct sequencing, 403arg-->leu and 403arg-->trp in families 720 and 730, respectively. the 403arg-->leu mutation was associated with incomplete penetrance, a high incidence of sudden deaths and severe cardiac events, whereas the consequences of the 403arg-->trp mutation appeared less severe. haplotyping of polymorphic markers in close linkage to the beta-myosin heavy chain gene can, thus, provide rapid analysis of non informative pedigrees and rapid detection of carrier status. our results also indicate that codon 403 of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene is a hot spot for mutations causing fhc.	-1
the identification and management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer in a large jordanian family.  the management of families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is challenging as screening for cancer in cdh1 mutation carriers is insufficiently sensitive and the commonly recommended option, prophylactic total gastrectomy, is associated with certain morbidity and even potential mortality. we describe the particular challenges associated with the diagnosis and management of a large jordanian family with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. a preliminary pedigree enabled dna testing for cdh1 mutation, denoted as c.1137g ? a, on 4 family members; all were identified as mutation carriers. a family information service was then conducted in amman, jordan, where 40 family members gathered and we provided education and counseling. signed permission enabled dna collection for cdh1 germline mutation studies. non-attendees were contacted and provided detailed information. twenty-three family members have been tested for cdh1; 13 were positive and 10 were negative. the proband, a cdh1 mutation carrier, has undergone successful prophylactic total gastrectomy. we are hopeful that this model can be repeated throughout jordan as well as other emerging countries where knowledge and action about hereditary cancer is lacking.	-1
a prospective study of total gastrectomy for cdh1-positive hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. up to 30% of families with hdgc have mutations in the e-cadherin gene, cdh1. the role of prophylactic versus therapeutic gastrectomy for hdgc was studied prospectively. eighteen consecutive patients with cdh1 mutations and positive family history were studied prospectively, including 13 without and 5 with symptoms. proportions were compared by fisher's exact test, and survival by the breslow modification of the wilcoxon rank-sum test. each patient underwent total gastrectomy (tg), and 17 (94%) were found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma. twelve of 13 asymptomatic patients had t1, n0 cancer, and only 2/12 (16%) had it diagnosed preoperatively despite state-of-the-art screening methods. each asymptomatic patient did well postoperatively, and no patient has recurred. for five symptomatic patients, each (100%) was found to have signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (p = 0.002 versus asymptomatic) by preoperative endoscopy; three (60%) had lymph node involvement and two (40%) had distant metastases at time of operation. two-year survival was 100% for asymptomatic and 40% for symptomatic patients (p < 0.01). the data show that asymptomatic patients with family history of hdgc and cdh1 mutation have high probability of having signet ring cell adenocarcinoma of the stomach that is not able to be diagnosed on endoscopy; when symptoms arise, the diagnosis can be made by endoscopy, but they have metastases and decreased survival. surveillance endoscopy is of limited value, and prophylactic gastrectomy (pg) is recommended for patients with family history of hdgc and cdh1 mutations.	-1

haplotypes and mutations of the pah locus in egyptian families with pku.  a high degree of molecular heterogeneneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus was established by examining rflp haplotypes and pah mutations in the families of 13 egyptians with phenylketenouria (pku). thirteen different haplotypes were unequivocally determined in these kindreds. haplotypes 1.8, 3.9, 4.3, 7.8, 22.11, 27.6, and 52.8 were found segregating with normal chromosomes, whilst haplotypes 1.8, 5.9, 23.8, 32.8, the newly assigned 73.9, and two as yet incomplete but novel haplotypes were found segregating with the mutant chromosomes. there was no particular preference for a single haplotype among normal or mutant chromosomes. nine different mutations were also identified among the 26 alleles. ivs 10nt11g (8/26), ivs 2nt5g-c (4/26), r261q (3/26), r176x (2/26), y206d (2/26), s231p (2/26), y198fs [593-614del22bp]; (2/26), g46fs [136/137delg]; (1/26), and e178g (1/26). six of these mutations (ivs 2nt5g-c, r176x, y198fs, r261q, s231p, and ivs 10nt11g) are common to other mediterranean populations. two mutations not previously reported in the mediterranean basin were also observed (y206d and g46fs). these intriguing preliminary findings confirm ivs 10nt11g as a major mutation among mediterranean mutations and demonstrate the need for a more comprehensive study of arab populations to confirm the uniqueness of the two novel mutations to the egyptian population.	-1
subtle abnormalities in contractile function are an early manifestation of sarcomere mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy.  sarcomere mutations cause both dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm); however, the steps leading from mutation to disease are not well described. by studying mutation carriers before a clinical diagnosis develops, we characterize the early manifestations of sarcomere mutations in dcm and investigate how these manifestations differ from sarcomere mutations associated with hcm. sixty-two genotyped individuals in families with sarcomeric dcm underwent clinical evaluation including strain echocardiography. the group included 12 subclinical dcm mutation carriers with normal cardiac dimensions and left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef ?55%), 21 overt dcm subjects, and 29 related mutation (-) normal controls. results were compared with a previously characterized cohort of 60 subclinical hcm subjects (sarcomere mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy). systolic myocardial tissue velocity, longitudinal, circumferential, and radial strain, and longitudinal and radial strain rate were reduced by 10%-23% in subclinical dcm mutation carriers compared with controls (p<0.001 for all comparisons), after adjusting for age and family relations. no significant differences in diastolic parameters were identified comparing the subclinical and control cohorts. the opposite pattern of contractile abnormalities with reduced diastolic but preserved systolic function was seen in subclinical hcm. subtle abnormalities in systolic function are present in subclinical dcm mutation carriers, despite normal left ventricular size and ejection fraction. in contrast, impaired relaxation and preserved systolic function appear to be the predominant early manifestations of sarcomere mutations that lead to hcm. these findings support the theory that the mutation's intrinsic impact on sarcomere function influences whether a dilated or hypertrophic phenotype develops.	-1
phenylketonuria mutations in germany.  we report the spectrum of mutations and associated modified haplotypes in patients with phenylketonuria living in germany. a total of 546 independent alleles was investigated, including 411 of german and 65 of turkish descent. mutations were identified for 535 pku alleles (98%) and there were 91 different mutations. the most common mutation was r408w on 22% of alleles. two mutations, ivs12+1g-->a and ivs10-11g-->a accounted for just under 10% of alleles, whereas the remaining mutations were found at relative frequencies of 6% or less; 43 mutations were observed once only. ivs10-11g-->a was the most common mutation (38% of alleles) in the subgroup of patients of turkish descent. modified haplotypes were determined from the analysis of four silent mutations, three diallelic restriction fragment length polymorphisms, a variable number of tandem repeats minisatellite and a short tandem repeat microsatellite in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, showing that a considerable proportion of mutations must have recurred in independent founders; other mutations may have changed chromosomal haplotype backgrounds by gene conversion. the spectrum of pku mutations in germany reflects the history of a heterogenous central european population living at the crossroads of migration throughout the centuries.	-1
increased braf heterodimerization is the common pathogenic mechanism for noonan syndrome-associated raf1 mutants.  noonan syndrome (ns) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder characterized by congenital heart defects, short stature, and facial dysmorphia. ns is caused by germ line mutations in several components of the ras-raf-mek-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway, including both kinase-activating and kinase-impaired alleles of raf1 (?3 to 5%), which encodes a serine-threonine kinase for mek1/2. to investigate how kinase-impaired raf1 mutants cause ns, we generated knock-in mice expressing raf1(d486n). raf1(d486n/+) (here d486n/+) female mice exhibited a mild growth defect. male and female d486n/d486n mice developed concentric cardiac hypertrophy and incompletely penetrant, but severe, growth defects. remarkably, mek/erk activation was enhanced in raf1(d486n)-expressing cells compared with controls. raf1(d486n), as well as other kinase-impaired raf1 mutants, showed increased heterodimerization with braf, which was necessary and sufficient to promote increased mek/erk activation. furthermore, kinase-activating raf1 mutants also required heterodimerization to enhance mek/erk activation. our results suggest that an increased heterodimerization ability is the common pathogenic mechanism for ns-associated raf1 mutations.	1
next-generation sequencing reveals the mutational landscape of clinically diagnosed usher syndrome: copy number variations, phenocopies, a predominant target for translational read-through, and pex26 mutated in heimler syndrome.  combined retinal degeneration and sensorineural hearing impairment is mostly due to autosomal recessive usher syndrome (ush1: congenital deafness, early retinitis pigmentosa (rp); ush2: progressive hearing impairment, rp). sanger sequencing and ngs of 112 genes (usher syndrome, nonsyndromic deafness, overlapping conditions), mlpa, and array-cgh were conducted in 138 patients clinically diagnosed with usher syndrome. a molecular diagnosis was achieved in 97% of both ush1 and ush2 patients, with biallelic mutations in 97% (ush1) and 90% (ush2), respectively. quantitative readout reliably detected cnvs (confirmed by mlpa or array-cgh), qualifying targeted ngs as one tool for detecting point mutations and cnvs. cnvs accounted for 10% of identified ush2a alleles, oftenin trans to seemingly monoallelic point mutations. we demonstrate ptc124-induced read-through of the common p.trp3955* nonsense mutation (13% of detectedush2a alleles), a potential therapy target. usher gene mutations were found in most patients with atypical usher syndrome, but the diagnosis was adjusted in case of double homozygosity for mutations inotoa andnr2e3, genes implicated in isolated deafness and rp. two patients with additional enamel dysplasia had biallelicpex26 mutations, for the first time linking this gene to heimler syndrome. targeted ngs not restricted to usher genes proved beneficial in uncovering conditions mimicking usher syndrome.	-1
mutation spectrum of myo7a and evaluation of a novel nonsyndromic deafness dfnb2 allele with residual function.  recessive mutations of myo7a, encoding unconventional myosin viia, can cause either a deaf-blindness syndrome (type 1 usher syndrome; ush1b) or nonsyndromic deafness (dfnb2). in our study, deafness segregating as a recessive trait in 24 consanguineous families showed linkage to markers for the dfnb2/ush1b locus on chromosome 11q13.5. a total of 23 of these families segregate ush1 due to 17 homozygous mutant myo7a alleles, of which 14 are novel. one family segregated nonsyndromic hearing loss dfnb2 due to a novel three-nucleotide deletion in an exon of myo7a (p.e1716del) encoding a region of the tail domain. we hypothesized that dfnb2 alleles of myo7a have residual myosin viia. to address this question we investigated the effects of several mutant alleles by making green fluorescent protein (gfp) tagged cdna expression constructs containing engineered mutations of mouse myo7a at codons equivalent to pathogenic ush1b and dfnb2 alleles of human myo7a. we show that in transfected mouse hair cells an ush1b mutant gfp-myosin viia does not localize properly to inner ear hair cell stereocilia. however, a gfp-myosin viia protein engineered to have an equivalent dfnb2 mutation to p.e1716del localizes correctly in transfected mouse hair cells. this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that p.e1716del causes a less severe phenotype (dfnb2) than the ush1b-associated alleles because the resulting protein retains some degree of normal function.	-1
rapid immunochromatographic detection of serum anti-?-galactosidase a antibodies in fabry patients after enzyme replacement therapy.  we developed an immunochromatography-based assay for detecting antibodies against recombinant ?-galactosidase a proteins in serum. the evaluation of 29 serum samples from fabry patients, who had received enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha and/or agalsidase beta, was performed by means of this assay method, and the results clearly revealed that the patients exhibited the same level of antibodies against both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta, regardless of the species of recombinant ?-galactosidase a used for enzyme replacement therapy. a conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay supported the results. considering these, enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta would generate antibodies against the common epitopes in both agalsidase alpha and agalsidase beta. most of the patients who showed immunopositive reaction exhibited classic fabry phenotype and harbored gene mutations affecting biosynthesis of ?-galactosidase a. as immunochromatography is a handy and simple assay system which can be available at bedside, this assay method would be extremely useful for quick evaluation or first screening of serum antibodies against agalsidase alpha or agalsidase beta in fabry disease with enzyme replacement therapy.	-1
molecular genetics of late onset glycogen storage disease ii in italy.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) is a recessively inherited disorder due to the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) that results in glycogen accumulation in the lysosomes. the molecular analysis of the gaa gene was performed on 45 italian patients with late onset gsdii. dhplc analysis revealed 28 polymorphisms spread all over the gaa gene. direct sequencing identified the 96% of the mutant alleles, 12 of which are novel. missense mutations were functionally characterized by enzyme activity and protein processing in a human gaa deficient cell line while splicing mutations were studied by rt-pcr and in silico analysis. a complex allele was also identified carrying three different alterations in cis. all the patients studied carried a severe mutation in combination with a milder one, which explains the late onset of the disease. the c.-32-13t > g was the most frequent mutation, present as compound heterozygote in 85% of the patients as described in other late onset gsdii caucasian populations. interestingly, 10 of the 45 patients carried the c.-32-13t > g associated to the severe c.2237g > a (p.w746x) mutation. however, despite the common genotype, patients presented with a wide variability in residual enzyme activity, age of appearance of clinical signs and rate of disease progression, suggesting that other genetic/environment factors may modulate clinical presentation.	-1
identification and functional characterization of gaa mutations in colombian patients affected by pompe disease.  pompe disease (pd) is a recessive metabolic disorder characterized by acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in all tissues, especially in skeletal muscles. pd clinical course is mainly determined by the nature of the gaa mutations. although ~400 distinct gaa sequence variations have been described, the genotype-phenotype correlation is not always evident.in this study, we describe the first clinical and genetic analysis of colombian pd patients performed in 11 affected individuals. gaa open reading frame sequencing revealed eight distinct mutations related to pd etiology including two novel missense mutations, c.1106 t > c (p.leu369pro) and c.2236 t > c (p.trp746arg). in vitro functional studies showed that the structural changes conferred by both mutations did not inhibit the synthesis of the 110 kd gaa precursor form but affected the processing and intracellular transport of gaa. in addition, analysis of previously described variants located at this position (p.trp746gly, p.trp746cys, p.trp746ser, p.trp746x) revealed new insights in the molecular basis of pd. notably, we found that p.trp746cys mutation, which was previously described as a polymorphism as well as a causal mutation, displayed a mild deleterious effect. interestingly and by chance, our study argues in favor of a remarkable afro-american and european ancestry of the colombian population. taken together, our report provides valuable information on the pd genotype-phenotype correlation, which is expected to facilitate and improve genetic counseling of affected individuals and their families.	1
utilizing ethnic-specific differences in minor allele frequency to recategorize reported pathogenic deafness variants.  ethnic-specific differences in minor allele frequency impact variant categorization for genetic screening of nonsyndromic hearing loss (nshl) and other genetic disorders. we sought to evaluate all previously reported pathogenic nshl variants in the context of a large number of controls from ethnically distinct populations sequenced with orthogonal massively parallel sequencing methods. we used hgmd, clinvar, and dbsnp to generate a comprehensive list of reported pathogenic nshl variants and re-evaluated these variants in the context of 8,595 individuals from 12 populations and 6 ethnically distinct major human evolutionary phylogenetic groups from three sources (exome variant server, 1000 genomes project, and a control set of individuals created for this study, the otodb). of the 2,197 reported pathogenic deafness variants, 325 (14.8%) were present in at least one of the 8,595 controls, indicating a minor allele frequency (maf) > 0.00006. mafs ranged as high as 0.72, a level incompatible with pathogenicity for a fully penetrant disease like nshl. based on these data, we established maf thresholds of 0.005 for autosomal-recessive variants (excluding specific variants in gjb2) and 0.0005 for autosomal-dominant variants. using these thresholds, we recategorized 93 (4.2%) of reported pathogenic variants as benign. our data show that evaluation of reported pathogenic deafness variants using variant mafs from multiple distinct ethnicities and sequenced by orthogonal methods provides a powerful filter for determining pathogenicity. the proposed maf thresholds will facilitate clinical interpretation of variants identified in genetic testing for nshl. all data are publicly available to facilitate interpretation of genetic variants causing deafness.	1
perturbation of palb2 function by the t413s mutation found in small cell lung cancer.  background: germline mutations in thepalb2 gene are associated with the genetic disorder fanconi anaemia and increased predisposition to cancer. disease-associated variants are mainly protein-truncating mutations, whereas a few missense substitutions are reported to perturb its interaction with breast cancer susceptibility proteins brca1 and brca2, which play essential roles in homology-directed repair (hdr). more recently, palb2 was shown to associate with active genes independently of brca1, and through this mechanism, safeguards these regions from dna replicative stresses. however, it is unknown whether palb2 tumour suppressor function requires its chromatin association.methods: mining the public database of cancer mutations, we identified four potentially deleterious cancer-associated missense mutations within the palb2 chromatin association motif (cham). to assess the impact of these mutations on palb2 function, we generated cell lines expressing palb2 variants harbouring corresponding cham mutations, and evaluated palb2 chromatin association properties and the cellular resistance to camptothecin (cpt). additionally, we examined the accumulation of ?h2a.x and the rad51 recombinase as readouts of dna damage signalling and hdr, respectively.results: we demonstrate that a small-cell lung cancer (sclc)-associated t413s mutation in palb2 impairs its chromatin association and confers reduced resistance to cpt, the only fda-approved drug for relapsed sclc. unexpectedly, we found a less efficient ?h2a.x nuclear foci formation in palb2 t413s expressing cells, whereas a near-normal level of rad51 nuclear foci was visible.conclusions: these findings support the importance of palb2 chromatin association in the suppression of tumours, including sclc, an unusually aggressive type of cancer with poor prognosis. palb2 t413s has little impact on rad51 recruitment, likely due to its intact interaction with brca1 and brca2. however, this mutant shows inefficient dna stress signalling. this finding sheds new light on the function of palb2, playing a role in efficient dna stress signalling through constitutive chromatin association.	1
"pah gene mutations in the sicilian population: association with minihaplotypes and expression analysis.  the molecular basis of pah deficiency in the sicilian population is characterized by a marked heterogeneity, with 44 mutations at a single locus identified by a ""gene-scanning"" approach and accounting for a detection rate of 91%. the remaining 9% of pah alleles does not bear mutations in any of the 13 exons and 24 exon/intron junctions. three mutations ivs10nt-11 g > a, r261q, and a300s accounted for 30.5%, whereas the remaining mutations were found at relative frequencies of less than 5% and 20 mutations were observed once only. five mutations have been detected only in sicilians so far. by studying the association of mutations with intragenic str-vntr haplotypes (""minihaplotypes""), ""identity by descent"" has been established for 24 mutations also detected in other populations. this finding supports the hypothesis of a multipolar origin for a large proportion of pah mutant alleles currently detected in sicilians. in order to improve our understanding of the clinical heterogeneity of pah deficiency in this population, we have for the first time analyzed three missense mutations l41f, t92i, and p211t in vitro by the pcdna3/cos-7 eukaryotic expression system and found an activity of 10, 76, and 72%, respectively, compared to normal pah. in two hpa patients with mild pku and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mhp), harboring respectively l41f/r261q and t92i/p281l genotypes, the predicted biochemical effect of these genotypes appeared to be consistent with the metabolic phenotypes. in contrast, discordant metabolic phenotypes (mild pku and mhp) were observed in two unrelated patients bearing the same r261q/p211t genotype, a finding which underscores the complex relationship linking genotype to phenotype in pah deficiency. hypotheses on the possible mechanisms responsible for the observed discordance are discussed. the spectrum of pah gene mutations in sicily reflects the complex demographic history of this island at the crossroad of prehistoric and historical migrations in the mediterranean sea. the data presented in this study also add to the present knowledge on the relationship between pah genotypes and hpa phenotype and are expected to improve pah genotyping among individuals with hyperphenylalaninemia."	1
comprehensive screening of the ush2a gene in usher syndrome type ii and non-syndromic recessive retinitis pigmentosa.  a screen of the entire coding region of the ush2a gene in 129 unrelated patients with usher syndrome type ii (ush2) and in 146 unrelated patients with non-syndromic autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arrp) uncovered 54 different sequence variations, including 18 likely pathogenic mutations (13 frameshift, three nonsense, and two missense), 12 changes of uncertain pathogenicity (11 missense changes and one in-frame deletion), and 24 non-pathogenic rare variants or polymorphisms. of the 18 likely pathogenic mutations, nine were novel. among the ush2 patients, 50 (39%) had one or two likely pathogenic mutations. the most common mutant allele in ush2 patients was e767fs, which was found in 29 patients, including one homozygote. among the arrp patients, we found 17 (12%) with one or two likely pathogenic mutations. the most common mutant allele in arrp patients was c759f and it was found in 10 patients. the c759f allele was also found in two ush2 patients; in neither of them was a change in the other allele found. the second most common mutant allele in both patient groups was l1447fs (found in 6/50 ush2 patients and 6/17 arrp patients). of the 50+17=67 patients with identified ush2a mutations, only one mutation in one allele was found in 41+12=53 (79%); the reason for the high proportion of patients with only one identified mutation is obscure. our results indicate that ush2a mutations are found in about 7% of all cases of rp in north america, a frequency similar to the rpgr gene (8%) and the rhodopsin gene (10%).	-1
the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene is not the predominant gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the finnish population.  the aim of the study was to screen 36 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm; 16 familial and 20 sporadic cases) from a genetically homogeneous area in eastern finland for variants in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-mhc) and alpha-tropomyosin (alpha-tm) genes. mutations in the beta-mhc and alpha-tm genes have been reported to be responsible for 30% to 40% and less than 5% of familial hcm cases, respectively. however, most genetic studies have included patients from tertiary care centers and are subject to referral bias. exons 3-26 and 40 of the beta-mhc gene and the nine exons of the alpha-tm gene were screened with the pcr-sscp (polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism) method. linkage analyses between familial hcm locus and two intragenic polymorphic markers (myo i and myo ii) of the beta-mhc gene were performed in 16 familial hcm kindreds. a previously reported arg719trp (arginine converted to tryptophan in codon 719) mutation of the beta-mhc gene was found in one proband and two relatives. in addition, a novel asn696ser (asparagine converted to serine in codon 696) substitution was found in one hcm patient. no linkage between familial hcm and the beta-mhc gene was observed in 16 familial kindreds. a previously reported aspl75asn (aspartic acid converted to asparagine in codon 175) mutation of the alpha-tm gene was found in four probands and 16 relatives. mutations in the beta-mhc and alpha-tm genes accounted for 6% and 25% familial hcm cases and 3% and 11% of all cases, respectively. our results indicate that the beta-mhc gene is not the predominant gene for hcm in the finnish population, whereas hcm caused by the aspl75asn mutation of the a-tm gene is more common than previously reported.	-1
in vitro analyses of known and novel runx1/aml1 mutations in dominant familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia: implications for mechanisms of pathogenesis.  familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (fpd/aml) is an autosomal dominant familial platelet disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a propensity to develop aml. mutation analyses of runx1 in 3 families with fpd/aml showing linkage to chromosome 21q22.1 revealed 3 novel heterozygous point mutations (k83e, r135fsx177 (ivs4 + 3dela), and y260x). functional investigations of the 7 fpd/aml runx1 runt domain point mutations described to date (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed. consistent with the position of the mutations in the runt domain at the runx1-dna interface, dna binding of all mutant runx1 proteins was absent or significantly decreased. in general, missense and nonsense runx1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with pebp2beta/cbfbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type runx1. colocalization of mutant runx1 and pebp2beta/cbfbeta in the cytoplasm was observed. these results suggest that the sequestration of pebp2beta/cbfbeta by mutant runx1 may cause the inhibitory effects. while haploinsufficiency of runx1 causes fpd/aml in some families (deletions and frameshifts), mutant runx1 proteins (missense and nonsense) may also inhibit wild-type runx1, possibly creating a higher propensity to develop leukemia. this is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur, either in runx1 or another gene, to cause leukemia among individuals harboring runx1 fpd/aml mutations and that the propensity to acquire these additional mutations is determined, at least partially, by the initial runx1 mutation.	1
characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging pattern in patients with macrocephaly and pten mutations.  we describe an mri phenotype seen in a series of patients with mutations in pten who have clinical features consistent with pten hamartoma tumor syndrome (phts). retrospective review of clinical data and mri was performed in 23 subjects evaluated in four different tertiary care centers with clinical programs in inherited disorders of the white matter. patients were referred due to abnormal mri features and abnormal pten sequencing was identified. all subjects had significant macrocephaly (on average >4 sd above the mean), developmental delay with or without autism spectrum disorder and uniform mri features of enlarged perivascular spaces and multifocal periventricular white matter abnormalities. the phenotype of phts may include mri abnormalities such as multifocal periventricular white matter abnormalities and enlarged perivascular spaces. these neuroimaging findings, in association with macrocephaly and developmental delay, should prompt consideration of pten as a diagnostic possibility.	-1
glycogenosis type ii: a juvenile-specific mutation with an unusual splicing pattern and a shared mutation in african americans.  the recessively inherited deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) called glycogenosis type ii is expressed as three different phenotypes: infantile, juvenile, and adult. at the molecular level, infantile and adult forms of the disease have been extensively studied, but little is known regarding the genetic defects associated with the juvenile form. we describe a novel mutation that defines the intermediate juvenile phenotype in a compound heterozygous patient. a transversion of t to g in intron 6 at position -22 creates a cryptic acceptor site and results in unusual splicing abnormality: insertion of 21 nucleotides of the intronic sequence into mrna and removal of exon 6 without disruption of the reading frame. the second mutation, arg854stop in exon 18, had been previously identified in another african-american patient (hermans et al., 1993a). family study indicates that a silent allele harboring the arg854stop mutation in our patient is inherited from the patient's father, who is also african-american, thus suggesting a common mutation in this population.	-1
somatic mosaicism for an hras mutation causes costello syndrome.  de novo heterozygous hras point mutations have been reported in more than 81 patients with costello syndrome (cs), but genotype/phenotype correlation remains incomplete because the majority of patients share a common mutation, g12s, seen in 65/81 (80%). somatic hras mutations have previously been identified in solid tumors, and mutation hot spots related to a gain-of-function effect of the gene product are known. the germline mutations causing cs occur at these hot spots and convey a gain-of-function effect, thus accounting for the greatly increased cancer risk. diagnostic testing for hras mutations is now available and the identification of a mutation in a patient with consistent clinical findings confirms a diagnosis of cs. it is not clear yet if the absence of an hras mutation precludes a diagnosis of cs. because there is a significant overlap in the clinical findings of costello, cardio-facio-cutaneous, and noonan syndromes, diagnostic uncertainty remains in patients lacking an hras mutation. we report here on a female with findings suggestive of cs in whom mutation analysis performed with standard techniques on white blood cell derived dna did not show an hras mutation. however, analysis of dna derived from three independently collected buccal swabs showed a sequence change qualitatively consistent with the g12s mutation. allelic quantitation showed the presence of the mutation in approximately 25%-30% of the sampled buccal cells. in this patient, standard technology failed to identify the disease causing mutation on dna derived from a blood sample, highlighting the potential pitfalls in the interpretation of negative mutation studies. this is the first reported cs patient mosaic for the common hras mutation, likely due to a somatic mutation occurring very early in fetal development.	-1
apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to a de novo mutation arg719trp of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene and cardiac arrest in childhood. a case report and family study.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a myocardial disease with variable phenotpye and genotype. to demonstrate that the mutation arg719trp in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain (beta mhc) gene is a high risk factor for sudden death and can be associated with an unusual apical non-obstructive hcm, we report the case of a 6 1/2 year old boy, who suffered cardiac arrest. the proband had a de novo mutation of the beta mhc gene (arg719trp) on the paternal beta mhc allele and a second maternally transmitted mutation (met349thr), as was shown previously (jeschke et al. 1998 (11)). here we report the clinical phenotype of the proband and of his relatives in detail. the proband had a marked apical and midventricular hypertrophy of the left and right ventricle without obstruction. there was an abnormal relaxation of both ventricles. holter monitoring detected no arrhythmia. ventricular fibrillation was inducible only by aggressive programmed stimulation. the boy died 3 1/2 years later after another cardiac arrest due to arrhythmia. five carriers of the met349thr mutation in the family were asymptomatic and had no echocardiographic changes in the heart, suggesting a neutral inherited polymorphism or a recessive mutation. it is concluded that there is an association of the mutation arg719trp in the beta-myosin heavy chain with sudden cardiac death in a young child. disease history in conjunction with the genetic analysis suggests that the implantation of a defibrillator converter would have been a beneficial and probably life saving measure.	-1
gjb2: the spectrum of deafness-causing allele variants and their phenotype.  genetic testing was completed on 1,294 persons with deafness referred to the molecular otolaryngology research laboratories to establish a diagnosis of dfnb1. exon 2 of gjb2 was screened for coding sequence allele variants by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) complemented by bidirectional sequencing. if two deafness-causing mutations of gjb2 (encoding connexin 26) were identified, further screening was not performed. if only a single deafness-causing mutation was identified, we screened for the g.1777179_2085947del (hereafter called del(gjb6-d13s1830); genbank nt_024524.13) and mutations in the noncoding region of gjb2. phenotype-genotype correlations were evaluated by categorizing mutations as either protein truncating or nontruncating. a total of 205 persons carried two gjb2 exon 2 mutations and were diagnosed as having dfnb1; 100 persons carried only a single deafness-causing allele variant of exon 2. a total of 37 of these persons were c.35delg carriers, and 51 carried other allele variants of gjb2. persons diagnosed with dfnb1 segregating two truncating/nonsense mutations had a more severe phenotype than persons carrying two missense mutations, with mean hearing impairments being 88 and 37%, respectively (p < 0.05). the number of deaf c.35delg carriers was greater than expected when compared to the c.35delg carrier frequency in normal-hearing controls (p < 0.05), suggesting the existence of at least one other mutation outside the gjb2 coding region that does not complement gjb2 deafness-causing allele variants.	-1
newborn screening for fabry disease in taiwan reveals a high incidence of the later-onset gla mutation c.936+919g>a (ivs4+919g>a).  fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a, gla) deficiency) is a panethnic inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism. because optimal therapeutic outcomes depend on early intervention, a pilot program was designed to assess newborn screening for this disease in 171,977 consecutive taiwanese newborns by measuring their dry blood spot (dbs) alpha-gal a activities and beta-galactosidase/alpha-gal a ratios. of the 90,288 male screenees, 638 (0.7%) had dbs alpha-gal a activity <30% of normal mean and/or activity ratios >10. a second dbs assay reduced these to 91 (0.1%). of these, 11 (including twins) had <5% (group-a), 64 had 5-30% (group-b), and 11 had >30% (group-c) of mean normal leukocyte alpha-gal a activity. all 11 group-a, 61 group-b, and 1 group-c males had gla gene mutations. surprisingly, 86% had the later-onset cryptic splice mutation c.936+919g>a (also called ivs4+919g>a). in contrast, screening 81,689 females detected two heterozygotes. the novel mutations were expressed in vitro, predicting their classical or later-onset phenotypes. newborn screening identified a surprisingly high frequency of taiwanese males with fabry disease (approximately 1 in 1,250), 86% having the ivs4+919g>a mutation previously found in later-onset cardiac phenotype patients. further studies of the ivs4 later-onset phenotype will determine its natural history and optimal timing for therapeutic intervention.	1
"phenotype and biochemical heterogeneity in late onset fabry disease defined by n215s mutation.  fabry disease (fd) results from x-linked inheritance of a mutation in the gla gene, encoding for alpha galactosidase a, and is characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations. two phenotypes have been described ""classic"" and ""late onset"" which cannot be predicted exclusively by genotype. the latter has been considered an attenuated form of the disease often affecting a single organ system commonly the heart. recent studies have demonstrated that cardiac outcomes are similar in patients with classic and late onset mutations. in this study we investigate the relationship between clinical heterogeneity and plasma lyso-gb3 in a large single centre cohort of n215s patients and compare this to patients with other mutations. in this single-centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study we analysed a cohort of 251 fd patients: 84 n215s mutation (37 males) and 167 non-n215s mutations (58 males). the mainz severity score index (mssi) was used as an index of overall disease severity. cardiac function and morphology were assessed by electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. left ventricular mass was calculated using the devereux formula and the left ventricular mass index (lvmi) calculated to adjust for height (g/m2.7). the presence of white matter lesions was assessed by cerebral mri or computed tomography (ct). gfr was measured by radio-isotope (chromium-edta) method and adjusted for patient height (ml/min/m2.7), and urinary protein quantification was undertaken by 24 hour urine collection. plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-gb3) was analysed prior to ert in 84 patients. n215s patients showed later symptom onset (males: p< 0.0001, females: p<0.03), later development of left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) (median survival without lvh: 41 (non-n215s) vs. 64 (n215s) years, p< 0.0001), later development of proteinuria (median survival without proteinuria 43 (non-n215s) vs 71 years (n215s), p< 0.0001), later occurrence of cerebrovascular events (stroke/ transient ischaemic attacks (tia); median survival without stroke: 74 years (non-n215s) vs. not reached (n215s), p< 0.02), later decline in renal function to gfr <60 ml/min/1.73m2 (median survival: 56 (non-n215s) vs. 72 (n215s) years, p< 0.01), and greater overall survival (median survival 81 (n215s) vs. 66 (non-n215s) years, p< 0.0006). lyso-gb3 was found to be less elevated in n215s compared to non-n215s male and female patients. however, the n215s population eventually reached an overall severity measured by mssi comparable to the non-n215s without equivalent elevation of lyso-gb3 (means: 6.7 vs. 74.3 nmol/l, p < 0.001). in addition, n215s patients showed strong correlations between lyso-gb3 levels and lvmi, gfr, and mssi. these associations became stronger when we investigated individuals' life time exposure to lyso-gb3 (calculated as [lyso-gb3]*age): mssi (r2 = 0.88, p< 0.0001), lvmi (r2 = 0.59, p< 0.005), and gfr (r2 = 0.75, p = 0.0001). these results demonstrate that the n215s mutation results in a late onset phenotype involving the heart and other organs. correlations between clinical manifestations and plasma lyso-gb3 variations in this group suggest a fabry-relevant disease mechanism for the heterogeneity observed in this group."	-1

novel mutations in gck and hnf1a genes in italian families with mody phenotype.  analysis of gck and hnf1a genes in 32 mody families identified three novel mutations: the missense mutation g170d and the deletion/insertion p432xfs in gck and the splicing mutation ivs4nt-1g>t, in hnf1a. for ivs4nt-1g>t the sequence analysis of rt-pcr products demonstrated exon skipping with the use of a cryptic splicing site.	-1
kras insertion mutations are oncogenic and exhibit distinct functional properties.  oncogenic kras mutations introduce discrete amino acid substitutions that reduce intrinsic ras gtpase activity and confer resistance to gtpase-activating proteins (gaps). here we discover a partial duplication of the switch 2 domain of k-ras encoding a tandem repeat of amino acids g60_a66dup in a child with an atypical myeloproliferative neoplasm. k-ras proteins containing this tandem duplication or a similar five amino acid e62_a66dup mutation identified in lung and colon cancers transform the growth of primary myeloid progenitors and of ba/f3 cells. recombinant k-ras(g60_a66dup) and k-ras(e62_a66dup) proteins display reduced intrinsic gtp hydrolysis rates, accumulate in the gtp-bound conformation and are resistant to gap-mediated gtp hydrolysis. remarkably, k-ras proteins with switch 2 insertions are impaired for pi3 kinase binding and akt activation, and are hypersensitive to mek inhibition. these studies illuminate a new class of oncogenic kras mutations and reveal unexpected plasticity in oncogenic ras proteins that has diagnostic and therapeutic implications.	1
haplotype analyses, mechanism and evolution of common double mutants in the human ldl receptor gene.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh), an autosomal dominant inherited disorder resulting in increased levels of circulating plasma low-density lipoprotein (ldl), tendon xanthomas and premature coronary artery disease (cad), is caused by defects in the ldl receptor gene (ldlr). three widespread ldlr alterations not causing fh (c.1061-8t>c, c.2177c>t and c.829g>a) and one mutation (c.12g>a) with narrow geographical distribution and thought to cause disease were investigated. in an attempt to improve knowledge on their origin, spread and possible selective effects, estimations of the ages of these variants (t generations) and haplotype analysis were performed by genotyping 86 healthy individuals and 98 fh patients in spain for five ldlr snps: c.81t>c, c.1413g>a, c.1725c>t, c.1959t>c, and c.2232g>a; most patients carried two of these ldlr variants simultaneously. it was found that both the c.1061-8t>c (t = 54) and c.2177c>t alterations (t = 62) arose at about the same time (54 and 62 generations ago, respectively) in the cgctg haplotype, while the c.12g>a mutation (t = 70) appeared in a cgccg haplotype carrying an earlier c.829g>a alteration (t = 83). the estimated ages of selectively neutral alterations could explain their distribution by migrations. the origin of the c.12g>a mutation could be in the iberian peninsula; despite its estimated age, a low selective pressure could explain its conservation in spain from where it could have spread to china and mexico, since the sixteenth century through the spanish/portuguese colonial expeditions.	-1
"founder effect of a prevalent phenylketonuria mutation in the oriental population.  a missense mutation has been identified in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase [pah; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase; l-phenylalanine, tetrahydrobiopterin:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating), ec 1.14.16.1] gene in a chinese patient with classic phenylketonuria (pku). a g-to-c transition at the second base of codon 413 in exon 12 of the gene results in the substitution of pro413 for arg413 in the mutant protein. this mutation (r413p) results in negligible enzymatic activity when expressed in heterologous mammalian cells and is compatible with a classic pku phenotype in the patient. population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is tightly linked to restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, which is the predominant haplotype of the pah locus in the oriental population. it accounts for 13.8% of northern chinese and 27% of japanese pku alleles, but it is rare in southern chinese (2.2%) and is absent in the caucasian population. the data demonstrate unambiguously that the mutation occurred after racial divergence of orientals and caucasians and suggest that the allele has spread throughout the orient by a founder effect. previous protein polymorphism studies in eastern asia have led to the hypothesis that ""northern mongoloids"" represented a founding population in asia. our results are compatible with this hypothesis in that the pku mutation might have occurred in northern mongoloids and subsequently spread to the chinese and japanese populations."	1
low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene mutations in canadian subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, but not of french descent.  heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a relatively common autosomal dominant disorder, which is characterized by elevated plasma concentrations of low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol and early coronary heart disease. fh results from mutations in the gene encoding the ldl receptor (ldlr). in canada, there is a founder effect for ldlr mutations in fh among individuals of french descent, most of whom reside in the province of quebec. however, the spectrum of mutations in other regions, specifically in the populous and predominantly english-speaking province of ontario, has not been studied. we sequenced the coding regions, promoter and intron-exon boundaries of the ldlr gene in 60 ontario fh subjects from a variety of ethnic backgrounds other than french canadian. we found 25 ldlr mutations in 34 subjects. eleven ldlr mutations were novel, including two in-frame deletions of a single amino acid (one each in exons 2 and 4), two larger deletions that shifted the reading frame (one each in exons 4 and 10), five missense mutations (c42r, a370t, t413m, l561p and e760d) and two splice acceptor mutations (one each in introns 3 and 8). the results indicate that fh is more genetically diverse in ontario than in quebec. the results are also consistent with findings from investigations of the ldlr in fh conducted in other countries, in which pcr-based, exon-by-exon sequencing uncovers small mutations in about half of the subjects screened. the gap in molecular diagnosis suggests that lesions not found by this sequencing strategy, such as larger scale ldlr mutations that cannot be amplified, may underlie a substantial number of cases of fh. alternatively, there might be genetic heterogeneity underlying the fh phenotype, with contributions from other single or multiple genes. hum mutat 18:359, 2001.	-1
costello syndrome associated with novel germline hras mutations: an attenuated phenotype?  costello syndrome is a rare congenital disorder typically characterized by severe failure-to-thrive, cardiac abnormalities including tachyarrhythmia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, distinctive facial features, a predisposition to papillomata and malignant tumors, neurologic abnormalities, developmental delay, and mental retardation. its underlying cause is de novo germline mutations in the oncogene hras. almost all costello syndrome mutations affect one of the glycine residues in position 12 or 13 of the protein product. more than 80% of patients with costello syndrome share the same underlying mutation, resulting in a g12s amino acid change. we report on two patients with novel hras mutations affecting amino acids 58 (t58i) and 146 (a146v), respectively. despite facial features that appear less coarse than those typically seen in costello patients, both patients show many of the physical and developmental problems characteristic for costello syndrome. these novel hras mutations may be less common than the frequently reported g12s change, or patients with these changes may be undiagnosed due to their less coarse facial features. in addition to the findings previously known to occur in costello syndrome, one of our patients had hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. this led us to review the medical histories on a cohort of proven hras mutation positive costello syndrome patients, and we found a statistically significantly (p < 0.001) increased frequency of pyloric stenosis in costello syndrome (5/58) compared to the general population frequency of 2-3/1,000. thus we add hypertrophic pyloric stenosis to the abnormalities seen with increased frequency in costello syndrome.	-1
two novel genetic lesions and a common bh4-responsive mutation of the pah gene in italian patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.  hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa), due to a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) enzyme, is caused by mutations in the pah gene. molecular analysis in 23 italian patients with pah deficiency identified two novel (p281r, l287v) and 20 previously described genetic lesions in the pah gene. the detection of the a403v amino acid substitution in combination with null mutations in patients with bh4-responsive pah deficiency leads us to correlate it with bh4 responsiveness.	-1
myopathy caused by hras germline mutations: implications for disturbed myogenic differentiation in the presence of constitutive hras activation.  rare reports on patients with congenital myopathy with excess of muscle spindles (cmems), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and variable features resembling noonan syndrome have been published, but the genetic basis of this condition is so far unknown. we analysed ptpn11 and ras genes in five unrelated patients with this phenotype, and found hras mutations in four of them. two disease-associated mutations, g12v and g12s, have previously been observed in patients with costello syndrome (cs), and two other mutations, e63k and q22k, are novel. all four mutations are predicted to enhance downstream hras signalling, suggesting that cmems is a developmental consequence of sustained hras activation in skeletal muscle. this type of myopathy may represent a previously unrecognized manifestation of cs. however, some patients carrying hras mutations may exhibit prominent congenital muscular dysfunction, although features of cs may be less obvious, suggesting that germline hras mutations may underlie some cases of otherwise unclassified neonatal neuromuscular disorders.	1
[the mutant spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in northern chinese].  to understand the mutant spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene in northern chinese. all the exons and flaking introns of pah gene were detected by pcr-single strand conformation polymorphism (pcr/sscp) and sequencing in 230 patients with phenylketonuria (pku). (1) a total of 75 different mutations were detected in 435 out of 460 mutant alleles (94.6%). among them 3 mutations (s251-r252>sfsx89, y387d and a389g) have not been reported previously. the mutations, r243q, ex6-96a>g, r111x, r413p and y356x, were the prevalent mutations with relative frequencies of 21.7%, 10.2%, 8.3%, 6.5%, and 6.1% respectively, followed by v399v(4.1%), ivs4-1g>a (3.5%), ivs7+2t>a (2.2%) and r241c(2.2%). most mutations were detected in exons 3, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 12 and flaking introns of pah gene. (2) ten polymorphism sites were detected in the study. four sites, ivs3-22c>t, ivs10+97g>a, q232q and v245v, had high relative frequencies of 56.7%, 75.9%, 89.0% and 81.9% respectively. it would suggest that the race diversity exists in pah cdna sequence. the mutation spectrum of pah gene in northern chinese is similar to other asian populations but significantly different from european populations.	-1
acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency (glycogenosis type ii, pompe disease).  glycogenosis type ii (gsdii, pompe disease) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase, gaa). the enzyme degrades alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose, and isomaltose. deficiency of the enzyme results in accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes and in cytoplasm eventually leading to tissue destruction. the discovery of the acid a-glucosidase gene has led to rapid progress in understanding the molecular basis of glycogenosis type ii and the biological properties of the gaa protein. the last decade has seen several developments: 1) extensive mutational analysis in patients with different forms of the disease, 2) characterization of the enzyme biosynthesis, processing, and lysosomal targeting, 3) generation of knockout mouse models, 4) development of viral vectors for gene replacement therapy, 5) the production of recombinant human enzyme, and 6) a shift in the enzyme replacement therapy approach from theory to practice. it is anticipated that the enzyme replacement therapy will be widely available for human use in the near future. several recent reviews (including the most comprehensive one by r. hirschhorn and a. reuser [1]), address clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects of the disease, as well as development of new therapies for gsdii [2, 3, 4]. in this article we will review recent findings in the area including rapidly accumulating molecular genetic data (more than 20 mutations need to be added to the list), transcriptional control of gene expression, studies in mouse models, and new approaches to gene therapy. we will also highlight some emerging questions following the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy.	-1
functional analysis of ptpn11/shp-2 mutants identified in noonan syndrome and childhood leukemia.  noonan syndrome (ns) is characterized by short stature, characteristic facial features, and heart defects. recently, missense mutations of ptpn11, the gene encoding protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) shp-2, were identified in patients with ns. further, somatic mutations in ptpn11 were detected in childhood leukemia. recent studies showed that the phosphatase activities of five mutations identified in ns and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (jmml) were increased. however, the functional properties of the other mutations remain unidentified. in this study, in order to clarify the differences between the mutations identified in ns and leukemia, we examined the phosphatase activity of 14 mutants of shp-2. we identified nine mutations, including a novel f71i mutation, in 16 of 41 ns patients and two mutations, including a novel g503v mutation, in three of 29 patients with leukemia. immune complex phosphatase assays of individual mutants transfected in cos7 cells showed that ten mutants identified in ns and four mutants in leukemia showed 1.4-fold to 12.7-fold increased activation compared with wild-type shp-2. these results suggest that the pathogenesis of ns and leukemia is associated with enhanced phosphatase activity of mutant shp-2. a comparison of the phosphatase activity in each mutant and a review of previously reported cases showed that high phosphatase activity observed in mutations at codons 61, 71, 72, and 76 was significantly associated with leukemogenesis.	1
close monitoring of initial enzyme replacement therapy in a patient with childhood-onset pompe disease.  pompe disease is classified into infantile and late-onset (childhood and adult) forms based on onset age and degree of organ involvement. while benefits of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) for the infantile form have been confirmed, efficacy for late-onset forms reportedly varies. we report close monitoring of initial ert, focusing especially on the first year, in a 12-year-old boy with childhood-onset pompe disease. at age 10, he started ert at 20 mg/kg every other week. respiratory and motor functions were evaluated at each infusion, and by skeletal muscle computed tomography (ct) and cardiac echography every 4 months. he gained the ability to climb stairs without a rail and % vital capacity improved just 1.5 months after starting ert. grip power, manual muscle testing (mmt) and the timed and 6-min walking distance tests (6mwt) improved promptly, paralleling improvements in clinical symptoms. however, this steady improvement stopped around 8 months, with deterioration to the initial level by about 24 months. antibody against recombinant human alpha-glucosidase was very low at 15 months; therefore, the lack of treatment response did not completely correspond to antibody production. on the other hand, cardiac wall thickening worsened after 4 months, then improved to better than baseline after 8 months, and this improvement was well maintained. among our set parameters, the timed test results corresponded better to his changing clinical course than did grip power, mmt or 6-min walking test results.	-1
differential regulation of pten expression by androgen receptor in prostate and breast cancers.  prostate cancer and breast cancer are the most common malignancies in the western world. androgen receptor (ar) and pten both have been well documented to have important roles in prostate carcinogenesis. in contrast, ar and pten in breast carcinogenesis have not been well studied. furthermore, the crosstalk and connection between those two pathways remain unclear. increased ar expression in prostate cancers, combined with decreased pten expression, portends a poor clinical outcome. paradoxically, both high ar and high pten levels, detected by immunohistochemistry, in primary breast carcinomas have been associated with better disease-free survival. here, we performed in silico analysis of publicly available microarray data sets from prostate or breast carcinomas. we found an inverse correlation between ar and pten transcript expression in prostate cancer tissues in contrast to the positive correlation in breast cancer. these data led us to hypothesize that ar may directly affect pten transcriptional regulation in prostate and breast cancer cells. here, we show for the first time that ar inhibits pten transcription in prostate cancer cells, whereas ar upregulates pten transcription in breast cancer cells, which mechanistically explains both the immunohistochemical pten-ar expressional data noted in clinical trials and in our in silico analysis of the transcriptomes of breast and prostate cancers. in addition, we have fine-mapped the ar-binding motif within the pten promoter. here we show that, in patients with cowden syndrome, an inherited cancer syndrome caused by germline mutations scattered throughout pten, point variants affecting the 3' end of the ar-binding motif result in abrogation of androgen-mediated transcriptional regulation of pten expression. we may speculate that the differential ar effect on pten may begin to explain organ-specific and perhaps sex-specific neoplasia predisposition in cowden syndrome, as well as why only a fraction of women with germline pten mutations develop breast cancer, depending on the androgen steroid milieu and levels.	1
unexpected mexiletine responses of a mutant cardiac na+ channel implicate the selectivity filter as a structural determinant of antiarrhythmic drug access.  gating properties of na(+) channels are the critical determinants for the state-dependent block by class i antiarrhythmic drugs; however, recent site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that the na(+) channel selectivity filter region controls drug access to and dissociation from the binding site. to validate these observations, we have exploited a naturally occurring cardiac na(+) channel mutation, s1710l, located next to the putative selectivity filter residue of domain 4, and evaluated the pharmacological properties to mexiletine using whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings. consistent with the large negative shift of steady-state inactivation and the enhanced slow inactivation, the s1710l channel showed greater mexiletine tonic block than wild-type (wt) channel. in contradiction, s1710l showed attenuated use-dependent block by mexiletine and accelerated recovery from block, suggesting that the drug escape though the external access path is facilitated. extracellularly applied qx-314, a membrane-impermeant derivative of lidocaine, elicited significantly enhanced tonic block in s1710l similar to mexiletine. however, recovery from internally applied qx-314 was accelerated by 4.4-fold in s1710l compared with wt. these results suggest that the drug access to and dissociation from the binding site through the hydrophilic path are substantially altered. moreover, k(+) permeability was 1.9-fold increased in s1710l, verifying that the mutated residue is located in the ion-conducting pore. we propose that the na(+) channel selectivity filter region is a structural determinant for the antiarrhythmic drug sensitivity in addition to gating properties of the indigenous na(+) channels that govern the state-dependent drug block.	1
mutational and phenotypical spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in denmark.  we describe the genotypes of the complete cohort, from 1967 to 2014, of phenylketonuria (pku) patients in denmark, in total 376 patients. a total of 752 independent alleles were investigated. mutations were identified on 744 pku alleles (98.9%). in total, 82 different mutations were present in the cohort. the most frequent mutation c.1315+1g>a (ivs12+1g>a) was found on 25.80% of the 744 alleles. other very frequent mutations were c.1222c>t (p.r408w) (16.93%) and c.1241a>g (p.y414c) (11.15%). among the identified mutations, five mutations; c.532g>a (p.e178k), c.730c>t (p.p244s), c.925g>a (p.a309t), c.1228t>a (p.f410i), and c.1199+4a>g (ivs11+4a>g) have not been reported previously. the metabolic phenotypes of pku are classified into four categories; 'classical pku', 'moderate pku', 'mild pku' and 'mild hyperphenylalaninemia'. in this study, we assigned the phenotypic outcome of three of the five novel mutations and furthermore six not previously classified mutations to one of the four pku categories.	1

pcsk9 variation and association with blood pressure in african americans: preliminary findings from the hypergen and regards studies.  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (encoded by pcsk9) plays a well-known role in the regulation of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptors, and an inhibitor of this enzyme is a promising new therapeutic for hyperlipidemia. recently, animal and human studies also implicate pcsk9 genetic variation in the regulation of blood pressure. the goal of this study was to examine if common and rare polymorphisms in pcsk9 are associated with blood pressure in an african-american population at high risk for cardiovascular disease. using genomic data assayed on the affymetrix 6.0 array (n = 1199) and the illumina humanexome beadchip (n = 1966) from the hypertension genetic epidemiology network (hypergen), we tested the association of pcsk9 polymorphisms with blood pressure. we used linear mixed models and the sequence kernel association test (skat) to assess the association of 31 common and 19 rare variants with blood pressure. the models were adjusted for age, sex, center, smoking status, principal components for ancestry and diabetes as fixed effects and family as a random effect. the results showed a marginally significant effect of two genome-wide association study (gwas) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) (rs12048828: ? = 1.8, p = 0.05 and rs9730100: ? = 1.0, p = 0.05) with diastolic blood pressure (dbp); however these results were not significant after correction for multiple testing. rare variants were cumulatively associated with dbp (p = 0.04), an effect that was strengthened by restriction to non-synonymous or stop-gain snps (p = 0.02). while gene-based results for dbp did not replicate (p = 0.36), we found an association with sbp (p = 0.04) in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke study (regards). the findings here suggest rare variants in pcsk9 may influence blood pressure among african americans, laying the ground work for further validation studies.	-1
to die or not to die: how does p53 decide?  p53 is frequently mutated in cancer and as a result is one of the most intensely studied tumour suppressors. analysis of the primitive forms of p53 found in caenorhabditis elegans and drosophila, alongside studies using transgenic mouse models, indicate that the induction of apoptosis is both the most conserved function of p53 and vital for tumour suppression. p53-mediated apoptosis occurs through a combination of mechanisms which include pathways that are both dependent and independent of alterations in gene expression. in response to genotoxic insult, these pathways probably act together, thereby amplifying the apoptotic signal. however, the picture is complicated because the p53 activity is determined by stress type and individual cellular characteristics. the numerous p53 responsive genes that have been identified also provide further means of controlling the actions of p53. the recent discoveries of proteins that interact with p53 and specifically regulate the ability of p53 to trigger apoptosis have provided further mechanistic insights into the role of p53 in inducing cell death. understanding the molecular basis of the proapoptotic action of p53 can assist in our quest to reintroduce or reactivate p53 in human tumours.	1
identification of a point mutation in the human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene causing infantile glycogenosis type ii.  two patients in a consanguineous indian family with infantile glycogenosis type ii were found to have a g to a transition in exon 11 of the human lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene. both patients were homozygous and both parents were heterozygous for the mutant allele. the mutation causes a glu to lys substitution at amino acid position 521, just three amino acids downstream from the catalytic site at asp-518. the mutation was introduced in wild type lysosomal alpha-glucosidase cdna and the mutant construct was expressed in vitro and in vivo. the glu to lys substitution is proven to account for the abnormal physical properties of the patients lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor and to prevent the formation of catalytically active enzyme. in homozygous form it leads to the severe infantile phenotype of glycogenosis type ii.	1
"high incidence of later-onset fabry disease revealed by newborn screening.  the classic phenotype of fabry disease, x-linked alpha -galactosidase a (alpha -gal a) deficiency, has an estimated incidence of approximately 1 in 50,000 males. the recent recognition of later-onset variants suggested that this treatable lysosomal disease is more frequent. to determine the disease incidence, we undertook newborn screening by assaying the alpha-gal a activity in blood spots from 37,104 consecutive italian male neonates. enzyme-deficient infants were retested, and ""doubly screened-positive"" infants and their relatives were diagnostically confirmed by enzyme and mutation analyses. twelve (0.03%) neonates had deficient alpha-gal a activities and specific mutations, including four novel missense mutations (m51i, e66g, a73v, and r118c), three missense mutations (f113l, a143t, and n215s) identified previously in later-onset patients, and one splicing defect (ivs5(+1g-->t)) reported in a patient with the classic phenotype. molecular modeling and in vitro overexpression of the missense mutations demonstrated structures and residual activities, which were rescued/enhanced by an alpha-gal a-specific pharmacologic chaperone, consistent with mutations that cause the later-onset phenotype. family studies revealed undiagnosed fabry disease in affected individuals. in this population, the incidence of alpha-gal a deficiency was 1 in approximately 3,100, with an 11 : 1 ratio of patients with the later-onset : classic phenotypes. if only known disease-causing mutations were included, the incidence would be 1 in approximately 4,600, with a 7 : 1 ratio of patients with the later-onset : classic phenotypes. these results suggest that the later-onset phenotype of fabry disease is underdiagnosed among males with cardiac, cerebrovascular, and/or renal disease. recognition of these patients would permit family screening and earlier therapeutic intervention. however, the higher incidence of the later-onset phenotype in patients raises ethical issues related to when screening should be performed--in the neonatal period or at early maturity, perhaps in conjunction with screening for other treatable adult-onset disorders."	1
molecular classification of patients with unexplained hamartomatous and hyperplastic polyposis.  significant proportions of patients with hamartomatous polyposis or with hyperplastic/mixed polyposis remain without specific clinical and molecular diagnosis or present atypically. assigning a syndromic diagnosis is important because it guides management, especially surveillance and prophylactic surgery. to systematically classify patients with unexplained hamartomatous or hyperplastic/mixed polyposis by extensive molecular analysis in the context of central rereview of histopathology results. prospective, referral-based study of 49 unrelated patients from outside institutions (n = 28) and at a comprehensive cancer center (n = 21), conducted from may 2, 2002, until december 15, 2004. germline analysis of pten, bmpr1a, stk11 (sequence, deletion), smad4, and eng (sequence), specific exon screening of braf, myh, and bhd, and rereview of polyp histology results were performed. molecular, clinical, and histopathological findings in patients with unexplained polyposis. of the 49 patients, 11 (22%) had germline mutations. of 14 patients with juvenile polyposis, 2 with early-onset disease had mutations in eng, encoding endoglin, previously only associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia; 1 had hemizygous deletion encompassing pten and bmpr1a; and 1 had an smad4 mutation. one individual previously classified with peutz-jeghers syndrome had a pten deletion. among 9 individuals with an unknown hamartomatous polyposis, 4 had mutations in stk11 (1), bmpr1a (2), and smad4 (1). of the 23 patients with hyperplastic/mixed polyposis, 2 had pten mutations. substantial discrepancies in histopathology results were seen. systematic molecular classification of 49 patients with unexplained hamartomatous or hyperplastic polyposis uncovered a potential novel susceptibility gene, eng, for juvenile polyposis. importantly, given the substantial proportion of patients found to have germline mutations, more extensive analysis of the known susceptibility genes is indicated. rereview of histology results by a dedicated gastrointestinal pathologist should be considered routinely, as organ-specific surveillance rests on defining syndromic diagnosis.	-1
long-term follow-up of patients with phenylketonuria treated with tetrahydrobiopterin: a seven years experience.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase that catalyzes the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, using tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) as coenzyme. besides dietary phenylalanine restriction, new therapeutic options are emerging, such as the treatment with bh4 in subgroups of pku patients responding to a loading test with bh4. a no-profit open-label interventional trial with long-term oral bh4 therapy, sponsored by the italian medicines agency (aifa), was performed in a group of 17 pku patients resulted as bh4 responders among 46 subjects analyzed for bh4-responsiveness (prot. farm5matc7). we report on efficacy and safety data of bh4 therapy and analyze factors predicting bh4-responsiveness and long-term response to bh4. a bh4-withdrawal test was used as a proof of the efficacy of long-term therapy with bh4. forty-four percent of the patients responded to the 48 h-long loading test with bh4. all the phenotypic classes were represented. genotype was the best predictor of responsiveness, along with lower phenylalanine levels at diagnosis, higher tolerance and lower phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio before the test. in bh4 responder patients, long-term bh4 therapy resulted safe and effective in increasing tolerance while maintaining a good metabolic control. the bh4 withdrawal test, performed in a subset of patients, showed that improved tolerance was directly dependent on bh4 assumption. tolerance to phenylalanine was re-evaluated in 43.5% of patients and was longitudinally analyzed in 5 patients. long-term treatment with bh4 is safe and effective in increasing tolerance to phenylalanine. there is real need to assess the actual tolerance to phenylalanine in pku patients to ameliorate quality of life, improve nutritional status, avoiding unnecessarily restricted diets, and interpret the effects of new therapies for pku.	-1
the nmd mrna surveillance pathway downregulates aberrant e-cadherin transcripts in gastric cancer cells and in cdh1 mutation carriers.  germline mutations in the gene encoding the tumour suppressor e-cadherin (cdh1) are the underlying genetic defect responsible for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc). a remarkably high percentage ( approximately 80%) of cdh1 mutations in hdgc patients and carriers generate premature termination codons (ptcs). here, we examined whether cdh1 transcripts harbouring ptcs are downregulated by nonsense-mediated decay (nmd), an rna surveillance pathway that degrades ptc-bearing transcripts. using an allele-specific expression (ase) assay to differentiate between mutated and wild-type cdh1 alleles, we found that ptc-bearing cdh1 mrnas are strongly downregulated in normal gastric tissue from several cdh1 mutation carriers. we show that nmd is responsible for this robust downregulation, as cdh1 transcripts harbouring ptcs in the kato-iii gastric tumour cell line were upregulated in response to protein synthesis inhibitors or depletion of the nmd factors upf1 and eif4aiii. analysis of hdgc patients harbouring cdh1 alleles with ptcs at a wide variety of different positions indicates an association of their predicted ability to induce nmd and an earlier age of onset of gastric cancer. this suggests that nmd may be detrimental for hdgc patients and therefore nmd is a potentially useful therapeutic target for cdh1 mutation carriers.	1
mutations identified in exon 7 of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in chinese.  exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene was analyzed in 45 children affected with classic phenylketonuria (pku) from northern china by using pcr-single strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) technique and dna direct sequencing. six missense mutations(i.e. r243q, r241h, g247v, l249h, f2541 and g257v) and one silent mutation (v245v) were identified. the latter three missense mutations were demonstrated as novel mutations in comparison with the pah mutation database. one missense mutation (r241h) was first documented in chinese. our results showed population and region differences in the pah mutation distribution, and suggest that there is more than one founding population for pku in china. the finding of novel mutations will enhence the molecular diagnosis of pku.	-1
mutations in the sarcomere gene myh7 in ebstein anomaly.  ebstein anomaly is a rare congenital heart malformation characterized by adherence of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve to the underlying myocardium. an association between ebstein anomaly with left ventricular noncompaction (lvnc) and mutations in myh7 encoding ?-myosin heavy chain has been shown; in this report, we have screened for myh7 mutations in a cohort of probands with ebstein anomaly in a large population-based study. mutational analysis in a cohort of 141 unrelated probands with ebstein anomaly was performed by next-generation sequencing and direct dna sequencing of myh7. heterozygous mutations were identified in 8 of 141 samples (6%). seven distinct mutations were found; 5 were novel and 2 were known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. all mutations except for 1 3-bp deletion were missense mutations; 1 was a de novo change. mutation-positive probands and family members showed various congenital heart malformations as well as lvnc. among 8 mutation-positive probands, 6 had lvnc, whereas among 133 mutation-negative probands, none had lvnc. the frequency of myh7 mutations was significantly different between probands with and without lvnc accompanying ebstein anomaly (p<0.0001). lvnc segregated with the myh7 mutation in the pedigrees of 3 of the probands, 1 of which also included another individual with ebstein anomaly. ebstein anomaly is a congenital heart malformation that is associated with mutations in myh7. myh7 mutations are predominantly found in ebstein anomaly associated with lvnc and may warrant genetic testing and family evaluation in this subset of patients.	-1
differential effect of dca treatment on the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in patients with severe pdhc deficiency.  dichloroacetate (dca) is a structural analog of pyruvate that has been recommended for the treatment of primary lactic acidemia, particularly in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdhc) deficiency. recent reports have demonstrated that the response to dca may depend on the type of molecular abnormality. in this study, we investigated the response to dca in various pdhc-deficient cell lines and tried to determine the mechanism involved. the effect of chronic 3-d dca treatment on pdhc activity was assessed in two pdhc-deficient cell lines, each with a different point mutation in the e1alpha subunit gene (r378c and r88c), and one cell line in which an 8-bp tandem repeat was deleted (w383 del). only two (r378c and r88c) of the three pdhc-deficient cell lines with very low levels of pdhc activity and unstable polypeptides were sensitive to chronic dca treatment. in these cell lines, dca treatment resulted in an increase in pdhc activity by 125 and 70%, respectively, with concomitant increases of 121 and 130% in steady-state levels of immunoreactive e1alpha. dca treatment reduced the turnover of the e1alpha subunit in r378c and r88c mutant cells with no significant effect on the e1beta subunit. chronic dca treatment significantly improved the metabolic function of pdhc in digitonin-permeabilized r378c and r88c fibroblasts. the occurrence of dca-sensitive mutations suggests that dca treatment is potentially useful as an adjuvant to ketogenic and vitamin treatment in pdhc-deficient patients.	-1
leopard syndrome with partly normal skin and sex chromosome mosaicism.  we report on a family with leopard syndrome which was molecularly proven (p.thr468met in ptpn11) in a father and his adult son. the father had multiple lentigines dispersed equally over his body; the son was similarly affected except for the left part of thorax, back and left arm, which were completely devoid of lentigines and only showed a few nevi. in addition, the son was found to have a mosaic karyotype, 47,xyy/46,xy, in lymphocytes. skin biopsies from the pigmented and unpigmented forearm showed that mainly a 47,xyy karyotype was present in the pigmented skin and mainly a 46,xy karyotype in the unpigmented skin. in both fibroblast cultures the ptpn11 mutation was present, and no additional mutation could be detected. we discuss the various possible explanations for this phenotype, which include the possibility of coincidence; revertant mosaicism; silencing of a second ptpn11 mutation; gene(s) located on a sex chromosome influencing the phenotype; and epigenetic influences. we favor that the co-occurrence of a sex chromosome mosaicism and mosaicism for skin symptoms in a single patient with leopard syndrome is coincidence, but that mosaicism for leopard skin symptoms in itself may well be more frequent and needs additional studies. each of the above-hypothesized mechanisms may then remain possible.	-1
algorithm for the early diagnosis and treatment of patients with cross reactive immunologic material-negative classic infantile pompe disease: a step towards improving the efficacy of ert.  although enzyme replacement therapy (ert) is a highly effective therapy, crim-negative (cn) infantile pompe disease (ipd) patients typically mount a strong immune response which abrogates the efficacy of ert, resulting in clinical decline and death. this study was designed to demonstrate that immune tolerance induction (iti) prevents or diminishes the development of antibody titers, resulting in a better clinical outcome compared to cn ipd patients treated with ert monotherapy. we evaluated the safety, efficacy and feasibility of a clinical algorithm designed to accurately identify cn ipd patients and minimize delays between crim status determination and initiation of an iti regimen (combination of rituximab, methotrexate and ivig) concurrent with ert. clinical and laboratory data including measures of efficacy analysis for response to ert were analyzed and compared to cn ipd patients treated with ert monotherapy. seven cn ipd patients were identified and started on the iti regimen concurrent with ert. median time from diagnosis of cn status to commencement of ert and iti was 0.5 months (range: 0.1-1.6 months). at baseline, all patients had significant cardiomyopathy and all but one required respiratory support. the iti regimen was safely tolerated in all seven cases. four patients never seroconverted and remained antibody-free. one patient died from respiratory failure. two patients required another course of the iti regimen. in addition to their clinical improvement, the antibody titers observed in these patients were much lower than those seen in ert monotherapy treated cn patients. the iti regimen appears safe and efficacious and holds promise in altering the natural history of cn ipd by increasing ert efficacy. an algorithm such as this substantiates the benefits of accelerated diagnosis and management of cn ipd patients, thus, further supporting the importance of early identification and treatment initiation with newborn screening for ipd.	-1
mutational analysis in uk patients with a clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia: relationship with plasma lipid traits, heart disease risk and utility in relative tracing.  as part of a randomised trial [genetic risk assessment for familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) trial] of the psychological consequences of dna-based and non-dna-based diagnosis of fh, 338 probands with a clinical diagnosis of fh (46% with tendon xanthomas) were recruited. in the dna-based testing arm (245 probands), using single-strand conformation polymorphism of all exons of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene, 48 different pathogenic mutations were found in 62 probands (25%), while 7 (2.9%) of the patients had the r3500q mutation in the apolipoprotein b (apob) gene. compared to those with no detected mutation, mean untreated cholesterol levels in those with the apob mutation were similar, while in those with an ldlr mutation levels were significantly higher (none=9.15+/-1.62 vs ldlr=9.13+/-1.16 vs apob=10.26+/-2.07 mmol/l p<0.001, respectively). thirty seven percent of the detected mutations were in exon 3/4 of ldlr, and this group had significantly higher untreated cholesterol than those with other ldlr mutations (11.71+/-2.39 mmol/l vs 9.88+/-2.44 mmol/l, p=0.03), and more evidence of coronary disease compared to those with other ldlr or apob mutations (36 vs 13% p=0.04). of the probands with a detected mutation, 54 first-degree relatives were identified, of whom 27 (50%) had a mutation. of these, 18 had untreated cholesterol above the 95th percentile for their age and gender, but there was overlap with levels in the non-carrier relatives such that 12% of subjects would have been incorrectly diagnosed on lipid levels alone. in the non-dna-based testing arm (82 probands) only 19 of the 74 relatives identified had untreated cholesterol above the 95th percentile for their age and gender, which was significantly lower (p<0.0005) than the 50% expected for monogenic inheritance. these data confirm the genetic heterogeneity of ldlr mutations in the uk and the deleterious effect of mutations in exon 3 or 4 of ldlr on receptor function, lipids and severity of coronary heart disease. in patients with a clinical diagnosis of fh but no detectable mutation, there is weaker evidence for a monogenic cause compared with relatives of probands with ldlr mutations. this supports the usefulness of dna testing to confirm diagnosis of fh for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia and for further cascade screening.	-1
rapid preparation of (3r,4s,5r) polyhydroxylated pyrrolidine-based libraries to discover a pharmacological chaperone for treatment of fabry disease.  the rapid discovery of a pharmacological chaperone toward human ?-gal a for the treatment of fabry disease is described. two polyhydroxylated pyrrolidines with the (3r,4s,5r) configuration pattern underwent rapid substituent diversity by conjugating the primary aminomethyl moiety of each with a variety of carboxylic acids to generate two libraries (2  60 members). our bioevaluation results showed one member with the (2r,3r,4s,5r) configuration pattern and bearing a 5-cyclohexylpentanoyl group as a substituent moiety possessed sufficient chaperoning capability to rescue ?-gal a activity in the lymphocyte of the n215s fabry patient-derived cell line and other ?-gal a mutants in cos7 cells.	1
germline tp53 mutations in patients with early-onset   colorectal cancer in the colon cancer family registry.  li-fraumeni syndrome, usually characterized by germline tp53 mutations, is associated with markedly elevated lifetime risks of multiple cancers, and has been linked to an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer. to examine the frequency of germline tp53 alterations in patients with early-onset colorectal cancer. this was a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study of individuals recruited to the colon cancer family registry (ccfr) from 1998 through 2007 (genetic testing data updated as of january 2015). both population-based and clinic-based patients in the united states, canada, australia, and new zealand were recruited to the ccfr. demographic information, clinical history, and family history data were obtained at enrollment. biospecimens were collected from consenting probands and families, including microsatellite instability and dna mismatch repair immunohistochemistry results. a total of a 510 individuals diagnosed as having colorectal cancer at age 40 years or younger and lacking a known hereditary cancer syndrome were identified from the ccfr as being potentially eligible. fifty-three participants were excluded owing to subsequent identification of germline mutations in dna mismatch repair genes (n = 47) or biallelic mutyh mutations (n = 6). germline sequencing of the tp53 gene was performed. identified tp53 alterations were assessed for pathogenicity using literature and international mutation database searches and in silico prediction models. frequency of nonsynonymous germline tp53 alterations. among 457 eligible participants (314, population-based; 143, clinic-based; median age at diagnosis, 36 years [range, 15-40 years]), 6 (1.3%; 95% ci, 0.5%-2.8%) carried germline missense tp53 alterations, none of whom met clinical criteria for li-fraumeni syndrome. four of the identified tp53 alterations have been previously described in the literature in probands with clinical features of li-fraumeni syndrome, and 2 were novel alterations. in a large cohort of patients with early-onset colorectal cancer, germline tp53 mutations were detected at a frequency comparable with the published prevalence of germline apc mutations in colorectal cancer. with the increasing use of multigene next-generation sequencing panels in hereditary cancer risk assessment, clinicians will be faced with the challenge of interpreting the biologic and clinical significance of germline tp53 mutations in families whose phenotypes are atypical for li-fraumeni syndrome.	-1
screening for pharmacological chaperones in fabry disease.  as a prerequisite for clinical trials of pharmacological chaperone therapy (pct) for fabry disease, we developed a rapid screening assay for enhancement of endogenous alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a) in patient-derived cells. we used a t-cell based system to screen 11 mutations causing fabry disease for enhanceability using 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj). when patient-derived t-cells were grown in the presence of dgj, alpha-gal a activity increased to more than 50% of normal in several mutations but was unaffected in others. in addition to the mutation r301q, reported previously, a97v, r112h, r112c, a143t, and l300p were enhanceable, but r356w, g132r, a143p, r220x, and 30delg were not. the level of alpha-gal a activity achieved provides a basis for the therapeutic trial of dgj in patients with similarly enhanceable enzyme. this assay method has general utility in other disorders in assessing the degree of enhancement of activity of mutated proteins by pct.	1
in vitro residual activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase variants and correlation with metabolic phenotypes in pku.  hyperphenylalaninemias (hpas) are genetic diseases predominantly caused by a wide range of variants in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. in vitro expression analysis of pah variants offers the opportunity to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in hpas and to clarify whether a disease-associated variant is genuinely pathogenic, while investigating the severity of a metabolic phenotype, and determining how a variant exerts its deleterious effects on the pah enzyme. to study the effects of gene variants on pah activity, we investigated eight variants: c.611a>g (p.y204c), c.635t>c (p.l212p), c.746t>c (p.l249p), c.745c>t (p.l249f), c.809g>a (p.r270k), c.782g>c (p.r261p), c.587c>a (p.s196y) and c.1139c>t (p.t380m), associated with different phenotypic groups. transient expression of mutant full-length cdnas in cos-7 cells yielded pah proteins with pah activity levels between 7% and 51% compared to the wild-type enzyme. with one exception (p.y204c, which had no significant impact on pah function), lower pah activity was associated with a more severe phenotype (e.g. p.l249p with 7% pah activity, 100% of classic pku and no bh4 responsiveness), while higher activity correlated with milder phenotypes (e.g. p.t380m with 28% pah activity, 97% of mild hpa and 83% of bh4 responsiveness). the results of the in vitro residual pah activity have major implications, both for our understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations, and thereby existing inconsistencies, but also for the elucidation of the molecular basis of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsiveness.	1
an apex-based genotyping microarray for the screening of 168 mutations associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an inborn disorder of lipid metabolism characterised by elevated plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol. this imbalance results in accelerated atherosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease. the early identification and treatment of fh patients is extremely important because it leads to significant reduction of both coronary morbidity and mortality. fh is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner and associated predominantly with mutations in the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and its ligand apolipoprotein b (apob). to date, more than 1000 sequence variants have been described in the ldlr gene. in marked contrast to ldlr, only one apob mutation is prevalent in europe. the aim of this study was, on the basis of data obtained by the molecular genetic analysis of 1945 czech fh probands, to propose, generate, and validate a new diagnostic tool, an apex (arrayed primer extension)-based genotyping dna microarray called the fh chip. the fh chip contains the apob mutation p.arg3527gln, all 89 ldlr point mutations and small dna rearrangements detected in czech fh patients, and 78 mutations frequent in other european and asian fh populations. the validation phase revealed the sensitivity and specificity of this platform, 100% and 99.1%, respectively. this fh chip is a rapid, reproducible, specific, and cost-effective tool for genotyping, and in combination with mlpa (multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification) represents a reliable molecular genetic protocol for the large-scale screening of fh mutations in the czech population.	-1
novel mutations in the long isoform of the ush2a gene in patients with usher syndrome type ii or non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa.  usher syndrome type ii (ush2) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by retinitis pigmentosa (rp) and mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. mutations in the ush2a gene are the most common cause of ush2 and are also a cause of some forms of rp without hearing loss (ie, non-syndromic rp). the ush2a gene was initially identified as a transcript comprised of 21 exons but subsequently a longer isoform containing 72 exons was identified. the 51 exons unique to the long isoform of ush2a were screened for mutations among a core set of 108 patients diagnosed with ush2 and 80 patients with non-syndromic rp who were all included in a previously reported screen of the short isoform of ush2a. for several exons, additional patients were screened. in total, 35 deleterious mutations were identified including 17 nonsense mutations, 9 frameshift mutations, 5 splice-site mutations, and 4 small in-frame deletions or insertions. twenty-seven mutations were novel. in addition, 65 rare missense changes were identified. a method of classifying the deleterious effect of the missense changes was developed using the summed results of four different mutation assessment algorithms, sift, pmut, polyphen, and agvgd. this system classified 8 of the 65 changes as 'likely deleterious' and 9 as 'possibly deleterious'. at least one mutation was identified in 57-63% of ush2 cases and 19-23% of cases of non-syndromic recessive rp (calculated without and including probable/possible deleterious changes) thus supporting that ush2a is the most common known cause of rp in the usa.	1
moyamoya syndrome in a patient with noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.  noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair is one of the rasopathies characterized by noonan syndrome-like features with unique ectodermal abnormalities. this syndrome is caused by mutations in the shoc2 gene. we encountered a patient with moyamoya syndrome associated with noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair presenting with transient ischemic attacks. a 6-year-old girl was diagnosed with noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair because of profound short stature and ectodermal anomalies such as sparse and easily pluckable hair. a heterozygous mutation of c.4a>g (p.s2g) in the shoc2 gene was identified, and recombinant human growth hormone therapy was initiated at 8 years of age. at age 10, she manifested recurrent left hemiplegia. moreover, cerebrovascular imaging revealed occlusion or narrowing of both internal carotid arteries and both middle cerebral arteries with distal moyamoya-like vessels. she is treated with aspirin and calcium channel blocker. we describe the first case of noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair associated with moyamoya syndrome, although it has been reported to be associated with a few cases of other rasopathies, including noonan, cardiofaciocutaneous, and costello syndromes. this report emphasizes the associations between cerebrovascular anomalies and noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair.	-1
expression patterns of cardiac myofilament proteins: genomic and protein analysis of surgical myectomy tissue from patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  mutations in myofilament proteins, most commonly mybpc3-encoded myosin-binding protein c and myh7-encoded beta-myosin heavy chain, can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm). despite significant advances in structure-function relationships pertaining to the cardiac sarcomere, there is limited knowledge of how a mutation leads to clinical hcm. we, therefore, set out to study expression and localization of myofilament proteins in left ventricular tissue of patients with hcm. frozen surgical myectomy specimens from 47 patients with hcm were examined and genotyped for mutations involving 8 myofilament-encoding genes. myofilament protein levels were quantified by western blotting with localization graded from immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections. overall, 25 of 47 (53%) patients had myofilament-hcm, including 12 with mybpc3-hcm and 9 with myh7-hcm. as compared with healthy heart tissue, levels of myofilament proteins were increased in patients manifesting a mutation in either gene. patients with a frameshift mutation predicted to truncate mybpc3 exhibited marked disturbances in protein localization as compared with missense mutations in either mybpc3 or myh7. in this first expression study in human hcm tissue, increased myofilament protein levels in patients with either mybpc3- or myh7-mediated hcm suggest a poison peptide mechanism. specifically, the mechanism of dysfunction may vary according to the genetic subgroup suggested by a distinctly abnormal distribution of myofilament proteins in patients manifesting a truncation mutation in mybpc3.	-1
a novel mutation of the gaa gene in a finnish late-onset pompe disease patient: clinical phenotype and follow-up with enzyme replacement therapy.  pompe disease is a rare, progressive disease leading to skeletal muscle weakness due to deficiency of the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) enzyme. herein we report the first diagnosed finnish patient with a phenotype compatible with the late-onset form of pompe disease. molecular genetic analysis of the gaa gene revealed a novel missense mutation, 1725c>a (y575x), combined with a previously reported mutation, 1634c>t (p545l). human recombinant alpha-glucosidase enzyme (alglucosidase-alpha) treatment was initiated for this patient at age 20 years. after 12 months she was no longer fully wheelchair-bound, and muscle strength had improved. no disease progression was visible on muscle magnetic resonance imaging of the lower limbs, and the energy state of the muscle cells increased by 46% on phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy. overall, our findings suggest that enzyme replacement therapy is indicated, even in patients with late-onset pompe disease, to halt disease progression and improve the quality of daily life.	-1
molecular and functional characterization of eight novel gaa mutations in italian infants with pompe disease.  we characterized 29 unrelated patients presenting with the severe form of pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type ii, acid maltase deficiency) and identified 26 pathogenic mutations divided over 28 different genotypes. among the eight new mutations, five were exonic point mutations (c.572a>g, c.1124g>t, c.1202a>g, c.1564c>g and c.1796c>a) leading to codon changes (p.y191c, p.r375l, p.q401r, p.p522a and p.s599y); two were intronic point mutations (c.-32-3c>a and c.1636+5g>c) affecting mrna processing; one was a single base deletion (c.742delc) generating a truncated protein (p.l248pfsx20). a comprehensive evaluation, based on different methodological approaches, confirmed the detrimental effect of the eight mutations on the protein and its function. structural alterations potentially induced by the five missense mutations were also predicted through visual inspection of the atomic model of the gaa protein, in terms of both function and spatial orientation of specific residues as well as disturbance generated by amino acid substitutions. although the remarkable heterogeneity of the mutational spectrum in pompe disease was already known, our data demonstrate and confirm the power of molecular and functional analysis in predicting the natural course of pompe disease.	1
myosin binding protein c: structural abnormalities in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  the muscle protein myosin binding protein c (mybpc) is a large multi-domain protein whose role in the sarcomere is complex and not yet fully understood. mutations in mybpc are strongly associated with the heart disease familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) and these experiments of nature have provided some insight into the intricate workings of this protein in the heart. while some regions of the mybpc molecule have been assigned a function in the regulation of muscle contraction, the interaction of other regions with various parts of the myosin molecule and the sarcomeric proteins, actin and titin, remain obscure. in addition, several intra-domain interactions between adjacent mybpc molecules have been identified. although the basic structure of the molecule (a series of immunoglobulin and fibronectin domains) has been elucidated, the assembly of mybpc in the sarcomere is a topic for debate. by analysing the mybpc sequence with respect to fhc-causing mutations it is possible to identify individual residues or regions of each domain that may be important either for binding or regulation. this review looks at the current literature, in concert with alignments and the structural models of mybpc, in an attempt to understand how fhc mutations may lead to the disease state.	-1
molecular correlations in phenylketonuria: mutation patterns and corresponding biochemical and clinical phenotypes in a heterogeneous california population.  we studied 133 california phenylketonuria (pku) patients and one obligate heterozygote to delineate the molecular basis of pku in a population with greater ethnic diversity than in previous studies, and to determine whether a correlation exists between genotype and clinical phenotype, with the latter defined by both the diagnostic pretreatment blood phenylalanine (phe) level and cognitive (iq) test scores. to determine pah genotypes, we used pcr-mediated amplification, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and direct sequencing on dried whole blood samples. where possible, mutation severity was defined according to predicted in vitro pah enzyme activity estimated by using cos cell expression analysis for a given mutation. we then asked whether mutation severity, as defined by such expression analysis, correlated with pretreatment phe levels or with iq test results. a mutation was identified in 236 (88%) of 267 mutant alleles. seventeen new mutant alleles were found; a47e, t81p, i102t, e182g, t328d, y343p, k371r, y387h, a389e, e422k, ivs9nt5, ivs11nt20, dels70, del364-368/del198-220, delf299, delt323, and -1c/t. in striking contrast to a number of studies in other populations, in this study, based on predicted pah activity, we observed no correlation between mutation severity and pretreatment phe levels. there was also no correlation between genotype and iq. we conclude that in samples collected from an ethnically heterogeneous population, there is no correlation of mutation severity with either pretreatment phe levels or iq measurement in treated patients. we caution that genetic counseling in pku should incorporate the notion that prognosis may not be predicted with precision based on mutation analysis in a given patient.	1
phenylketonuria in the netherlands: 93% of the mutations are detected by single-strand conformation analysis.  single-strand conformational analysis was used to screen for genetic defects in all thirteen exons of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) in phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia patients in the netherlands. exons that showed a bandshift were sequenced directly. in this way, we were able to identify 93% of the pah mutations in a panel of 34 patients. twenty-one different mutations were found: 4 of these gene aberrations are novel.	-1
a japanese patient with li-fraumeni syndrome who had nine primary malignancies associated with a germline mutation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene.  we describe a patient who had nine primary malignant tumors and a germline mutation in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, characteristically found in the li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs). a 15-year-old girl with no family history of cancer was referred to our hospital because of pain and swelling of the right knee. osteosarcoma was diagnosed. the patient received chemotherapy followed by surgery and had a remission. after the age of 28 years, nine primary malignant tumors developed successively, including right breast cancer, colon cancer, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (mfh) of the abdominal wall, right lung double cancers, bilateral breast cancers, and mfh of the left thigh. this is the second highest number of types of primary malignant tumors to be reported in lfs. all tumors were treated by a multidisciplinary approach, including surgery. genetic analysis revealed a germline missense mutation in the p53 gene (c.659 a > g), resulting in y220c, which has been reported in three families with lfs. the patient died of lung metastasis from mfh at the age of 37 years. despite the multiple tumors, repeated induction of remissions resulted in long survival. our findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, including surgery, is beneficial in patients with lfs.	-1
identification of a pten mutation in a family with cowden syndrome and bannayan-zonana syndrome.  cowden syndrome (cs) and bannayan-zonana syndrome (bzs) are two inherited hamartoma syndromes characterized by distinct phenotypic features. mutations in the pten gene have been identified in patients with cs and bzs, suggesting the presence of a common genetic basis. we describe a single kindred with individuals manifesting both cs and bzs phenotypes (cs/bzs overlap family) in which we have identified a novel mutation in pten by dna sequencing. we have confirmed these results by means of restriction enzyme analysis. the presence of individuals with cs and bzs within the same family, and moreover the identification of identical pten gene mutations in these individuals, suggest that these two syndromes represent different phenotypic expressions of one disease. furthermore, these findings imply that, like patients with cs, individuals with bzs should be monitored for the onset of malignancy.	-1
mutation spectrum of six genes in chinese phenylketonuria patients obtained through next-generation sequencing.  the identification of gene variants plays an important role in the diagnosis of genetic diseases. to develop a rapid method for the diagnosis of phenylketonuria (pku) and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) deficiency, we designed a multiplex, pcr-based primer panel to amplify all the exons and flanking regions (50 bp average) of six pku-associated genes (pah, pts, gch1, qdpr, pcbd1 and gfrp). the ion torrent personal genome machine (pgm) system was used to detect mutations in all the exons of these six genes. we tested 93 dna samples from blood specimens from 35 patients and their parents (32 families) and 26 healthy adults. using strict bioinformatic criteria, this sequencing data provided, on average, 99.14% coverage of the 39 exons at more than 70-fold mean depth of coverage. we found 23 previously documented variants in the pah gene and six novel mutations in the pah and pts genes. a detailed analysis of the mutation spectrum of these patients is described in this study. these results were confirmed by sanger sequencing. in conclusion, benchtop next-generation sequencing technology can be used to detect mutations in monogenic diseases and can detect both point mutations and indels with high sensitivity, fidelity and throughput at a lower cost than conventional methods in clinical applications.	-1
germline mutations of tp53 and brca2 genes in breast cancer/sarcoma families.  the genetic aetiology of familial aggregations of breast cancer and sarcomas has been elucidated only in part. in this study, 23 unrelated individuals from families with one case of sarcoma and at least one case of breast cancer were screened for mutations in the tp53, brca1 and brca2 genes. families were classified according to their conformity to the criteria defining the li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs), li-fraumeni-like (lfl) syndrome and hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (hboc). germline tp53 mutations were identified in three instances (13%), including one lfs and two lfl families, while none of the non-lfs/non-lfl families had a tp53 mutation. three cases (13%), including one with a tp53 mutation, carried brca2 mutations. of these, two were observed in lfl/hboc families and the other one in a non-lfs/non-lfl/hboc family, while none of the non-hboc families tested positive. these findings suggest that the screening of brca2, in addition to tp53, may be appropriate for the molecular characterisation of breast cancer/sarcoma families, with practical implications for counselling and clinical management.	-1
molecular genetics of familial hypercholesterolemia in spain: ten novel ldlr mutations and population analysis.  mutations underlying fh in spain are largely unknown because only a few and limited surveys have been carried out on spanish fh patients up to now. to gain information on this issue, we have analysed a group of 113 unrelated spanish fh patients from an eastern area of spain (valencian community). we have screened the ldlr gene by southern blot and pcr-sscp analysis to detect large rearrangements and small mutations, respectively. in addition, we have screened the apo b gene for mutations known to cause fdb by pcr-sscp analysis. we have identified a total of 47 different mutations in the ldlr gene (5 large rearrangements, and 42 small mutations, which were characterized by dna sequencing), 19 of which have not been described in other populations (valencia-1 to -4, 112insa, p160r, 790delatga, 920instcag, g642e, and the ten novel mutations e246a, 884delt, i289t, s305f, q328x, y354c, i603del, 2312-3c>a, v779m, and n804k). three of these mutations (15%) were present in more than 1 proband, being mutation 112insa the most prevalent (frequency approximately 8%) in our sample. the apo b gene r3500q mutation was found in only one patient and no underlying defect was found in about 27% of patients. our data support the notion that spaniards represent a heterogeneous population with its own spectrum of ldlr gene mutations and that, in our population, fdb has a lower frequency or a milder expression than in central europe countries.	-1
increased atpase activity produced by mutations at arginine-1380 in nucleotide-binding domain 2 of abcc8 causes neonatal diabetes.  gain-of-function mutations in the genes encoding the atp-sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channel subunits kir6.2 (kcnj11) and sur1 (abcc8) are a common cause of neonatal diabetes mellitus. here we investigate the molecular mechanism by which two heterozygous mutations in the second nucleotide-binding domain (nbd2) of sur1 (r1380l and r1380c) separately cause neonatal diabetes. sur1 is a channel regulator that modulates the gating of the pore formed by kir6.2. k(atp) channel activity is inhibited by atp binding to kir6.2 but is stimulated by mgadp binding, or by mgatp binding and hydrolysis, at the nbds of sur1. functional analysis of purified nbd2 showed that each mutation enhances mgatp hydrolysis by purified isolated fusion proteins of maltose-binding protein and nbd2. inhibition of atp hydrolysis by mgadp was unaffected by mutation of r1380, but inhibition by beryllium fluoride (which traps the atpase cycle in the prehydrolytic state) was reduced. mgadp-dependent activation of k(atp) channel activity was unaffected. these data suggest that the r1380l and r1380c mutations enhance the off-rate of p(i), thereby enhancing the hydrolytic rate. molecular modeling studies supported this idea. because mutant channels were inhibited less strongly by mgatp, this would increase k(atp) currents in pancreatic beta cells, thus reducing insulin secretion and producing diabetes.	1
haploinsufficiency of cbfa2 causes familial thrombocytopenia with propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukaemia.  familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukaemia (fpd/aml, mim 601399) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects, and propensity to develop acute myelogenous leukaemia (aml). informative recombination events in 6 fpd/aml pedigrees with evidence of linkage to markers on chromosome 21q identified an 880-kb interval containing the disease gene. mutational analysis of regional candidate genes showed nonsense mutations or intragenic deletion of one allele of the haematopoietic transcription factor cbfa2 (formerly aml1) that co-segregated with the disease in four fpd/aml pedigrees. we identified heterozygous cbfa2 missense mutations that co-segregated with the disease in the remaining two fpd/aml pedigrees at phylogenetically conserved amino acids r166 and r201, respectively. analysis of bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from affected fpd/aml individuals showed a decrement in megakaryocyte colony formation, demonstrating that cbfa2 dosage affects megakaryopoiesis. our findings support a model for fpd/aml in which haploinsufficiency of cbfa2 causes an autosomal dominant congenital platelet defect and predisposes to the acquisition of additional mutations that cause leukaemia.	-1
identification of seven novel germline mutations in the human e-cadherin (cdh1) gene.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutation of the gene encoding the tumour-suppressor e-cadherin (cdh1). we describe the search for cdh1 mutations in 36 new diffuse gastric cancer families. all 16 cdh1 exons, neighbouring intronic sequence and an essential promoter region were screened by dna sequencing. we detected nine different mutations, seven of which were novel. of the seven novel mutations, five were identified in families who met the igclc clinical criteria for hdgc. two mutations resulted in a premature stop codon and truncation of the protein. three mutations affected splice sites; two of the splice-site mutations were shown by rt-pcr to disturb normal cdh1 splicing, while the third splice-site mutation was present in two unrelated hdgc families. the remaining two mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions and impaired the ability of e-cadherin protein to form cellular aggregates and suppress invasion in vitro. together with the occurrence of extra-gastric tumours such as lobular breast and colorectal cancer, these findings further extend the types of cdh1 mutations and the spectrum of tumours associated with hdgc.	1
sarcomere mutation-specific expression patterns in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  heterozygous mutations in sarcomere genes in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) are proposed to exert their effect through gain of function for missense mutations or loss of function for truncating mutations. however, allelic expression from individual mutations has not been sufficiently characterized to support this exclusive distinction in human hcm. sarcomere transcript and protein levels were analyzed in septal myectomy and transplant specimens from 46 genotyped hcm patients with or without sarcomere gene mutations and 10 control hearts. for truncating mutations in mybpc3, the average ratio of mutant:wild-type transcripts was ?1:5, in contrast to ?1:1 for all sarcomere missense mutations, confirming that nonsense transcripts are uniquely unstable. however, total mybpc3 mrna was significantly increased by 9-fold in hcm samples with mybpc3 mutations compared with control hearts and with hcm samples without sarcomere gene mutations. full-length mybpc3 protein content was not different between mybpc3 mutant hcm and control samples, and no truncated proteins were detected. by absolute quantification of abundance with multiple reaction monitoring, stoichiometric ratios of mutant sarcomere proteins relative to wild type were strikingly variable in a mutation-specific manner, with the fraction of mutant protein ranging from 30% to 84%. these results challenge the concept that haploinsufficiency is a unifying mechanism for hcm caused by mybpc3 truncating mutations. the range of allelic imbalance for several missense sarcomere mutations suggests that certain mutant proteins may be more or less stable or incorporate more or less efficiently into the sarcomere than wild-type proteins. these mutation-specific properties may distinctly influence disease phenotypes.	-1
association of functionally significant melanocortin-4 but not melanocortin-3 receptor mutations with severe adult obesity in a large north american case-control study.  functionally significant heterozygous mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) have been implicated in 2.5% of early onset obesity cases in european cohorts. the role of mutations in this gene in severely obese adults, particularly in smaller north american patient cohorts, has been less convincing. more recently, it has been proposed that mutations in a phylogenetically and physiologically related receptor, the melanocortin-3 receptor (mc3r), could also be a cause of severe human obesity. the objectives of this study were to determine if mutations impairing the function of mc4r or mc3r were associated with severe obesity in north american adults. we studied mc4r and mc3r mutations detected in a total of 1821 adults (889 severely obese and 932 lean controls) from two cohorts. we systematically and comparatively evaluated the functional consequences of all mutations found in both mc4r and mc3r. the total prevalence of rare mc4r variants in severely obese north american adults was 2.25% (ci(95%): 1.44-3.47) compared with 0.64% (ci(95%): 0.26-1.43) in lean controls (p < 0.005). after classification of functional consequence, the prevalence of mc4r mutations with functional alterations was significantly greater when compared with controls (p < 0.005). in contrast, the prevalence of rare mc3r variants was not significantly increased in severely obese adults [0.67% (ci(95%): 0.27-1.50) versus 0.32% (ci(95%): 0.06-0.99)] (p = 0.332). our results confirm that mutations in mc4r are a significant cause of severe obesity, extending this finding to north american adults. however, our data suggest that mc3r mutations are not associated with severe obesity in this population.	1
long term clinical history of an italian cohort of infantile onset pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy.  enzyme replacement therapy (ert) has deeply modified the clinical history of infantile onset pompe disease (iopd). however, its long-term effectiveness is still not completely defined. available data shows a close relationship between clinical outcome and patients' cross-reactive immunological status (crim), being crim-negative status a negative prognostic factor. at the same time limited data are available on the long-term treatment in crim-positive infants. a retrospective multicentre observational study was designed to analyse the long-term effectiveness of ert in iopd. thirteen italian centres spread throughout the country were involved and a cohort of 28 patients (15 females, 13 males, born in the period: february 2002-january 2013) was enrolled. iopd diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, enzymatic and molecular analysis. all patients received ert within the first year of life. clinical, laboratory, and functional data (motor, cardiac and respiratory) were collected and followed for a median period of 71 months (5 years 11 months). median age at onset, diagnosis and start of ert were 2, 3 and 4 months, respectively. crim status was available for 24/28 patients: 17/24 (71%) were crim-positive. nineteen patients (67%) survived > 2 years: 4 were crim-negative, 14 crim-positive and one unknown. six patients (5 crim-positive and one unknown) never needed ventilation support (21,4%) and seven (6 crim-positive and one unknown: 25%) developed independent ambulation although one subsequently lost this function. brain imaging study was performed in 6 patients and showed peri-ventricular white matter abnormalities in all of them. clinical follow-up confirmed the better prognosis for crim-positive patients, though a slow, progressive worsening of motor and/or respiratory functions was detected in 8 patients. these data are the result of the longest independent retrospective study on ert in iopd reported so far outside clinical trials. the data obtained confirmed the better outcome of the crim-positive patients but at the same time, showed the inability of the current therapeutic approach to reverse or stabilize the disease progression. the results also evidenced the involvement of central nervous system in pompe disease. to better understand the disease clinical history and to improve treatment efficacy larger multicentre studies are needed as well as the development of new therapeutic approaches.	1

human homozygous r403w mutant cardiac myosin presents disproportionate enhancement of mechanical and enzymatic properties.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) is associated with mutations in 11 genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. most families present mutations in mybpc3 and myh7 encoding cardiac myosin-binding protein c and beta-myosin heavy chain. the consequences of myh7 mutations have been extensively studied at the molecular level, but controversial results have been obtained with either reduced or augmented myosin motor function depending on the type or homogeneity of myosin studied. in the present study, we took advantage of the accessibility to an explanted heart to analyze for the first time the properties of human homozygous mutant myosin. the patient exhibited eccentric hypertrophy with severely impaired ejection fraction leading to heart transplantation, and carries a homozygous mutation in myh7 (r403w) and a heterozygous variant in mybpc3 (v896m). in situ analysis of the left ventricular tissue showed myocyte disarray and hypertrophy plus interstitial fibrosis. in vitro motility assays showed a small, but significant increase in sliding velocity of fluorescent-labeled actin filaments over human mutant cardiac myosin-coated surface compared to control (+18%; p<0.001). mutant myosin exhibited a large increase in maximal actin-activated atpase activity (+114%; p<0.05) and km for actin (+87%; p<0.05) when compared to control. these data show disproportionate enhancement of mechanical and enzymatic properties of human mutant myosin. this suggests inefficient atp utilization and reduced mechanical efficiency in the myocardial tissue of the patient, which could play an important role in the development of fhc phenotype.	1
characterization of a recurrent germ line mutation of the e-cadherin gene: implications for genetic testing and clinical management.  to identify germ line cdh1 mutations in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) families and develop guidelines for management of at risk individuals. we ascertained 31 hdgc previously unreported families, including 10 isolated early-onset diffuse gastric cancer (dgc) cases. screening for cdh1 germ line mutations was done by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated dna sequencing. we identified eight inactivating and one missense cdh1 germ line mutation. the missense mutation conferred in vitro loss of protein function. two families had the previously described 1003c>t nonsense mutation. haplotype analysis revealed this to be a recurrent and not a founder mutation. thirty-six percent (5 of 14) of the families with a documented dgc diagnosed before the age of 50 and other cases of gastric cancer carried cdh1 germ line mutations. two of 10 isolated cases of dgc in individuals ages <35 years harbored cdh1 germ line mutations. one mutation positive family was ascertained through a family history of lobular breast cancer (lbc) and another through an individual with both dgc and lbc. occult dgc was identified in five of six prophylactic gastrectomies done on asymptomatic, endoscopically negative 1003c>t mutation carriers. in addition to families with a strong history of early-onset dgc, cdh1 mutation screening should be offered to isolated cases of dgc in individuals ages <35 years and for families with multiple cases of lbc, with any history of dgc or unspecified gi malignancies. prophylactic gastrectomy is potentially a lifesaving procedure and clinical breast screening is recommended for asymptomatic mutation carriers.	-1
spectrum of ldl receptor gene mutations in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia by usual definition reflects mutations of the ldl-receptor gene. extensive molecular characterization of mutations ascertained mainly through homozygotes (the dallas collection) has been presented by hobbs et al. (hum mutat 1:445-446, 1992). this paper catalogues a spectrum of 134 mutations (27 novel mutations in 45 patients, 24 previously described mutations in 89 patients) ascertained through heterozygotes from the analysis of 791 patients with definite, probable, or possible fh, mainly from the uk, using high-throughput modifications of the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. from a composite database of ldl receptor gene mutations complied from these two sets and from the literature, deductions are made about ascertainment bias, mutation rates, and molecular heterogeneity. calculations suggest that there may be a large number of rare amino acid variants in the general population not causing classic fh. approaches to, and feasibility of, molecular diagnostics are considered.	-1
identification of a small deletion in one allele of patients with infantile form of glycogen storage disease type ii.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsd ii, pompe's disease) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-d-glucosidase. in this paper we report two unrelated chinese patients with infantile form of gsd ii who had compound heterozygotes containing a small deletion in one of the acid alpha-d-glucosidase alleles. in both of these compound heterozygotes, one allele contains the c1935a transversion which is the most common mutation in chinese patients and the other allele contains the newly identified 4 nt deletion of coding sequence (deletion nt 1411-1414). this small deletion causes a reading frameshift and translational premature termination signal in exon 9.	-1

hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy mutations differentially affect the molecular force generation of mouse alpha-cardiac myosin in the laser trap assay.  point mutations in cardiac myosin, the heart's molecular motor, produce distinct clinical phenotypes: hypertrophic (hcm) and dilated (dcm) cardiomyopathy. do mutations alter myosin's molecular mechanics in a manner that is predictive of the clinical outcome? we have directly characterized the maximal force-generating capacity (f(max)) of two hcm (r403q, r453c) and two dcm (s532p, f764l) mutant myosins isolated from homozygous mouse models using a novel load-clamped laser trap assay. f(max) was 50% (r403q) and 80% (r453c) greater for the hcm mutants compared with the wild type, whereas f(max) was severely depressed for one of the dcm mutants (65% s532p). although f(max) was normal for the f764l dcm mutant, its actin-activated atpase activity and actin filament velocity (v(actin)) in a motility assay were significantly reduced (schmitt jp, debold ep, ahmad f, armstrong a, frederico a, conner da, mende u, lohse mj, warshaw d, seidman ce, seidman jg. proc natl acad sci usa 103: 14525-14530, 2006.). these f(max) data combined with previous v(actin) measurements suggest that hcm and dcm result from alterations to one or more of myosin's fundamental mechanical properties, with hcm-causing mutations leading to enhanced but dcm-causing mutations leading to depressed function. these mutation-specific changes in mechanical properties must initiate distinct signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the disparate phenotypic responses observed in hcm and dcm.	1
negative regulation of stat3 by activating ptpn11 mutants contributes to the pathogenesis of noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.  noonan syndrome (ns) is an autosomal dominant congenital disorder characterized by multiple birth defects including heart defects and myeloproliferative disease (mpd). approximately 50% of ns patients have germline gain-of-function mutations in ptpn11, which encodes the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, shp2. we provide evidence that conditional ablation of stat3 in hematopoietic cells and cardiac valvular tissues leads to myeloid progenitor hyperplasia and pulmonary stenosis due to the leaflet thickening, respectively. consistently, stat3 activation is significantly compromised in peripheral blood cells from ns patients bearing shp2-activating mutations. biochemical and functional analyses demonstrate that activated shp2 is able to down-regulate tyr(p)-stat3 and that constitutively active stat3 rescues activating mutant shp2-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor hypersensitivity in bone marrow cells. collectively, our work demonstrates that stat3 is an essential signaling component potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of ns and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia caused by ptpn11 gain-of-function mutations.	1
counteracting effects operating on src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (shp2) function drive selection of the recurrent y62d and y63c substitutions in noonan syndrome.  activating mutations in ptpn11 cause noonan syndrome, the most common nonchromosomal disorder affecting development and growth. ptpn11 encodes shp2, an src homology 2 (sh2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively modulates ras function. here, we characterized functionally all possible amino acid substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 62 and 63 to explore the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the y62d and y63c substitutions recurring in noonan syndrome. we provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the n-sh2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the n-sh2 domain. most mutations affecting tyr(63) exerted an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the n-sh2 phosphopeptide-binding cleft mediating the interaction of shp2 with signaling partners. among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease-causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of the inactive conformation of shp2 without severely impairing proper phosphopeptide binding of n-sh2. on the other hand, the disruptive effect of the y62d change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant. overall, our data demonstrate that the selection-by-function mechanism acting as driving force for ptpn11 mutations affecting codons 62 and 63 implies balancing of counteracting effects operating on the allosteric control of the function of shp2.	1
long-term follow-up results in enzyme replacement therapy for pompe disease: a case report.  pompe disease (pd) is a metabolic myopathy caused by a deficiency of acid-alpha glucosidase (gaa), a lysosomal enzyme that cleaves glycogen. the classic infantile-onset form is characterised by severe hypotonia and cardiomyopathy. untreated patients usually die within the first year of life due to cardiorespiratory failure. several studies involving patients with infantile-onset pd have shown that enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with alglucosidase alfa, recombinant human gaa (rhgaa), significantly prolongs survival, decreases cardiomegaly, and improves cardiac function and conduction abnormalities. however, the efficacy on motor, cognitive and social milestones appears to be more related to the condition of the patient before the start of treatment. to date, the sample of early diagnosed and treated patients is small and the length of follow-up is still limited. we report the results of a long-term follow-up of one patient presenting severe bradycardia and cardiomyopathy at birth, diagnosed in the third day of life and successfully treated by ert. serum muscle enzymes at diagnosis were ast 200 u/l, alt 99 u/l and cpk 731 u/l (n.v. 0-295); the molecular study identified the homozygous missense mutation c.1933 g> a p.asp645asn (gaa exon 14). left ventricular mass index (lvmi) at baseline was 171 g/m(2) (z-score = 4.3) and decreased to normal values since the 3-month follow-up. a muscle biopsy performed at 18 months after the start of therapy, showed only a low degree of muscle involvement. to our knowledge, this is the longest ert treatment follow-up in a symptomatic neonatal patient with pompe disease.	-1
t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia arising from familial platelet disorder.  familial platelet disorder (fpd) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder which causes moderate thrombocytopenia with or without impaired platelet function. patients have a propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (aml), and various types of second hits have been postulated in the evolution to aml. however, only a few cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (all) have been reported thus far. here, we report a family of fpd with a germ-line hemi-allelic mutation r174x in the runx1 gene. the proband of the family developed aml and her son had all of the t cell lineage. the balanced translocation t(1;7)(p34.1;q22) was detected in the lymphoblasts from the patient with all. this translocation was not seen in any other affected members of the family or in the bone marrow sample of this patient in complete remission. taken together, t(1;7)(p34.1;q22) is thought to be one of the somatic second hits that predisposes fpd to acute leukemia with t cell phenotype.	-1
molecular genetics and impact of residual in vitro phenylalanine hydroxylase activity on tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in turkish pku population.  the prevalence of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah)-deficient phenylketonuria (pku) in turkey is high (1 in 6500 births), but data concerning the genotype distribution and impact of the genotype on tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) therapy are scarce. to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic variability in the turkish pku population and to correlate it with physiological response to bh(4) challenge. we genotyped 588 hyperphenylalaninemic patients and performed a bh(4) loading test (20mg/kg bw) in 462 patients. residual pah activity of mutant proteins was calculated from available in vitro expression data. data were tabulated in the biopku database (www.biopku.org). eighty-eight mutations were observed, the most common missense mutations being the splice variant c.1066-11g>a (24.6%). twenty novel mutations were detected (11 missense, 4 splice-site, and 5 deletion/insertions). two mutations were observed in 540/588 patients (91.8%) but in 9 patients atypical genotypes with >2 mutations were found (8 with p.r155h in cis with another variant) and in 19 patients mutations were found in bh(4)-metabolizing genes. the most common genotype was c.1066-11g>a/c.1066-11g>a (15.5%). approximately 22% of patients responded to bh(4) challenge. a substantial in vitro residual activity (average >25% of the wild-type enzyme) was associated with response to bh(4). in homozygous genotypes (n=206), both severity of the phenotype (r=0.83) and residual pah activity (r=0.85) correlate with bh(4) responsiveness. together with the bh(4) challenge, these data enable the genotype-based classification of bh(4) responsiveness and document importance of residual pah activity. this first report of a large-scale genotype assessment in a population of turkish pku patients also documents a high prevalence (47%) of the severe classic phenotype.	1
the natural course of infantile pompe's disease: 20 original cases compared with 133 cases from the literature.  infantile pompe's disease is a lethal cardiac and muscular disorder. current developments toward enzyme replacement therapy are promising. the aim of our study is to delineate the natural course of the disease to verify endpoints of clinical studies. a total of 20 infantile patients diagnosed by the collaborative dutch centers and 133 cases reported in literature were included in the study. information on clinical history, physical examination, and diagnostic parameters was collected. the course of pompe's disease is essentially the same in the dutch and the general patient population. symptoms start at a median age of 1.6 months in both groups. the median age of death is 7.7 and 6 months, respectively. five percent of the dutch patients and 8% of all reported patients survive beyond 1 year of age. only 2 patients from literature became older than 18 months. a progressive cardiac hypertrophy is characteristic for infantile pompe's disease. the diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall and cardiac weight at autopsy increase significantly with age. motor development is severely delayed and major developmental milestones are generally not achieved. for the dutch patient group, growth deviates significantly from normal despite start of nasogastric tube feeding. levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, or creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme are typically elevated, although aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase increase significantly with age. the patients have fully deleterious mutations. acid alpha-glucosidase activity is severely deficient. survival, decrease of the diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and achievement of major motor milestones are valid endpoints for therapeutic studies of infantile pompe's disease. mutation analysis and measurement of the alpha-glucosidase activity should be part of the enrollment program.	-1
breast cancer-associated missense mutants of the palb2 wd40 domain, which directly binds rad51c, rad51 and brca2, disrupt dna repair.  heterozygous carriers of germ-line mutations in the brca2/fancd1, palb2/fancn and rad51c/fanco dna repair genes have an increased lifetime risk of developing breast, ovarian and other cancers; bi-allelic mutations in these genes clinically manifest as fanconi anemia (fa). here, we demonstrate that rad51c is part of a novel protein complex that contains palb2 and brca2. further, the palb2 wd40 domain can directly and independently bind rad51c and brca2. to understand the role of these homologous recombination (hr) proteins in dna repair, we functionally characterize effects of missense mutants of the palb2 wd40 domain that have been reported in breast cancer patients. in contrast to large truncations of palb2, which display a complete loss of interaction, the l939w, t1030i and l1143p missense mutants/variants of the palb2 wd40 domain are associated with altered patterns of direct binding to the rad51c, rad51 and brca2 hr proteins in biochemical assays. further, the t1030i missense mutant is unstable, whereas the l939w and l1143p proteins are stable but partially disrupt the palb2-rad51c-brca2 complex in cells. functionally, the l939w and l1143p mutants display a decreased capacity for dna double-strand break-induced hr and an increased cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation. as further evidence for the functional importance of the hr complex, rad51c mutants that are associated with cancer susceptibility and fa also display decreased complex formation with palb2. together, our results suggest that three different cancer susceptibility and fa proteins function in a dna repair pathway based upon the palb2 wd40 domain binding to rad51c and brca2.	1
cognitive functions in patients with phenylketonuria in long-term treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin.  cognitive functions were assessed in 9 patients with mild to moderate phenylketonuria (pku) ranging from 6 to 18 years of age, who were in long-term treatment (>5 years) with 5-9 mg/kg/day tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) on compassionate use, provided by schircks inc. an extensive study of cognitive functions (intelligence quotient (iq), visuospatial, visual memory, fine motor, executive and attentional functions) was conducted, and behavior was assessed using the adhd rating scale and the behavior rating inventory of executive function (brief). all patients had normal iq (m=107, sd=10). the most notable area of impairment was fine motor function, but no significant difference was found between the pku patients in bh4 treatment who participated in the current study and pku patients in dietary treatment who participated in a previous study. these results, however, should be interpreted with caution. it is necessary to conduct further studies with a larger number of patients, using more sensitive tests of motor function and using the formulation of bh4 that is currently available.	-1
next generation deep sequencing corrects diagnostic pitfalls of traditional molecular approach in a patient with prenatal onset of pompe disease.  pompe disease is a rare inherited metabolic disorder of glycogen metabolism caused by mutations in the gaa gene, encoding the acid ?-1,4 glucosidase. successful diagnosis of pompe disease is achieved by clinical and biochemical evaluation followed by confirmation with dna testing. here, we report a male infant with a prenatal onset of cardiac symptoms and enzyme testing consistent with pompe disease, but dna testing by sanger sequencing revealed no pathogenic variants. due to the strong indication from clinical, enzymatic, and histological studies (despite the absence of molecular confirmation by traditional sanger sequencing), enzyme replacement therapy (ert) for pompe disease was initiated. reanalysis of the patient's dna sample using next generation sequencing (ngs) of a panel of target genes causing glycogen storage disorders demonstrated compound heterozygosity for a point mutation and an exonic deletion in the gaa gene. this case illustrates the value of astute clinical judgement in patient management as well as the power of target capture deep ngs in the simultaneous detection of both a point mutation and a heterozygous exonic deletion by correcting pitfalls of the traditional pcr based sequencing, namely; allele dropout and the inability to detect exonic deletions.	-1
genetic and phenotypic aspects of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in spain: molecular survey by regions.  we present an extensive study of the genetic diversity of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the spanish phenylketonuria population. we have analysed 195 pku patients by dgge analysis identifying 67 different mutations which represent 89% of the total mutant chromosomes. seventeen mutations first described in spain have not yet been detected elsewhere; ten of these are reported here for the first time. the clinical significance of this high genetic heterogeneity was examined by analysing the genotype-phenotype correlations, mainly focusing on the mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (mhp) phenotype. the genotypes found in a group of 93 mhp patients, the largest analysed so far, are described in detail, as well as the relative frequencies of the mhp mutations identified. from the total pool of mutations, 27 can be considered severe, 18 can be defined as mild and 13 as associated with mhp. the prevalent mutations correspond to one severe mutation (ivs10nt-11), one mhp mutation (a403v) and two mild mutations (165t and v388m). the high frequency of mutations with a low degree of severity can explain the relatively higher prevalence of mhp and mild pku phenotypes in spain compared with northern european populations. we have looked at the geographical distribution in spain of the more common mutations, finding evidence of local mutation clustering, which could be the result of differences in the ethnic background and/or of genetic drift within each region.	-1
spectrum of ldl receptor gene mutations in denmark: implications for molecular diagnostic strategy in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.  heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is one of the most common potentially fatal single-gene diseases leading to premature coronary artery disease, but the majority of heterozygous fh patients have not been diagnosed. fh is due to mutations in the gene coding for the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor, and molecular genetic diagnosis may facilitate identification of more fh subjects. the danish spectrum of 29 different mutations, five of which account for almost half of heterozygous fh, is intermediate between that of countries such as south africa, where three mutations cause 95% of heterozygous fh in the afrikaners, and germany or england, where there are many more mutations. in clinical practice, a strategy for the genetic diagnosis of heterozygous fh, tailored to the mutational spectrum of patients likely to be seen at the particular hospital/region of the country, will be more efficient than screening of the whole ldl receptor gene by techniques such as single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis in every heterozygous fh candidate. in aarhus, denmark, we have chosen to examine all heterozygous fh candidates for the five most common ldl receptor gene mutations (w23x, w66g, w556s, 313 + 1g --> a, 1846 - 1g --> a) and the apob-3500 mutation by rapid restriction fragment analysis. negative samples are examined for other mutations by sscp analysis followed by dna sequencing of the exon indicated by sscp to contain a mutation. if no point mutation or small insertion/deletion is detected, southern blot or long pcr analysis is performed to look for the presence of large gene rearrangements. in conclusion, our data suggest that an efficient molecular diagnostic strategy depends on the composition of common and rare mutations in a population.	-1
two mutations affecting the transport and maturation of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase in an adult case of glycogen storage disease type ii.  the autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease type ii is associated with a deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). this paper reports on the mutations in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase alleles of an adult patient. a g-1927 to a transition was discovered in exon 14 causing the substitution of gly-643 by arg and a second c-2173 to t transition in exon 15 resulting in the substitution of arg-725 by trp. each of the mutations was located in a different allele. the mutations were introduced in the wild-type lysosomal alpha-glucosidase cdna and expressed in cos cells. both mutations had a similar effect. the synthesis of the mutant enzyme precursors was not disturbed but the intracellular transport and maturation were impaired. as a result there was an overall deficiency of catalytic activity.	1
outcome of patients with classical infantile pompe disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy in germany.  enzyme replacement therapy (ert) has been shown to improve outcome in classical infantile pompe disease. the purpose of this study was to assess mortality, morbidity, and shortcomings of ert in a larger cohort of patients treated outside clinical trials. to accomplish this, we retrospectively analyzed the data of all 23 subjects with classical infantile pompe disease having started ert in germany between january 2003 and december 2010. ten patients (43%) deceased and four others (17%) became ventilator dependent. seven infants (30.5%) made no motor progress at all, while seven (30.5%) achieved free sitting, and nine (39%) gained free walking. besides all the seven patients (100%) attaining no improvement of motor functions, four out of the seven (57%) achieving to sit without support, and three out of the nine (33%) being able to walk independently, secondarily deteriorated, and died or became ventilator dependent. sustained reduction of systolic function despite reversal of cardiac hypertrophy (n = 3), gastroesophageal reflux (n = 5), swallowing difficulties or failure to thrive (n = 11), recurrent pneumonias (n = 14), port system complications (n = 4), anesthesia-related incidents (n = 2), severe allergic reactions (n = 6), hearing loss (n = 3), and orthopedic deformities (n = 4) were problems frequently encountered. although this study has important shortcomings due to its retrospective nature and because important variables potentially influencing outcome were not available for a substantial amount of patients, these data suggest that classical infantile pompe disease still remains a life-threatening condition associated with high morbidity and often dismal prognosis. currently, a relevant number of patients do not benefit definitely from ert.	-1
cardiac response to enzyme replacement therapy in infantile pompe disease with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  classic infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd), characterized by predominantly cardiac involvement, used to be considered uniformly lethal within months. the availability of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) has transformed the course of the disease. decrease in ventricular hypertrophy and improvement in ventricular function have been suggested as proof for efficacy. we report the cardiac response to ert of a child with iopd and severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the myocardial hypertrophy resolved. change in ejection fraction, however, was slow. we discuss the potential benefit of other parameters beyond ejection to assess cardiac function in iopd, including speckle tracking-based strain.	-1
mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (mc4r) gene in obese patients in norway.  mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor ( mc4r) gene are the most frequent cause of monogenic forms of obesity, but the reported prevalences of mutations in obese individuals diverge, varying from 0.2 to 5.8%. the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of mc4r mutations in obese children and adults residing in norway. we sequenced the coding region of mc4r in 1 027 obese patients. among these, were 644 adults with a bmi >35 kg/m(2) and 383 children with a body weight >97.5 percentile for height. identified mutations were analyzed by family studies and a bioinformatic approach including comparative sequence analysis and prediction of impact on transmembrane helix and three dimensional structure. nine mutations were identified, of which four were novel and five previously described. the prevalence of mc4r mutations was 1.6% in pediatric and 0.8% in adult patients. all four novel mutations, i69r, m79i, i195s, and m200del were identified among pediatric patients. m79i was found in an ethnic norwegian patient, while the rest were identified in second generation immigrants. the previously described mutations y35x/d37v, v95i, t150i, r236c and v253i were identified in one pediatric and five adult patients. none of the adult patients reported childhood onset of obesity. the m200del mutation was found in a homozygous state, while the rest were heterozygous. mc4r mutations are not a common cause of obesity in norway and screening of obese patients does not appear to be warranted. the results are consistent with results from previous studies.	-1
pompe disease results in a golgi-based glycosylation deficit in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.  infantile-onset pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the complete loss of lysosomal glycogen-hydrolyzing enzyme acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) activity, which results in lysosomal glycogen accumulation and prominent cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology. the mechanism by which loss of gaa activity causes cardiomyopathy is poorly understood. we reprogrammed fibroblasts from patients with infantile-onset pompe disease to generate induced pluripotent stem (ips) cells that were differentiated to cardiomyocytes (ipsc-cm). pompe ipsc-cms had undetectable gaa activity and pathognomonic glycogen-filled lysosomes. nonetheless, pompe and control ipsc-cms exhibited comparable contractile properties in engineered cardiac tissue. impaired autophagy has been implicated in pompe skeletal muscle; however, control and pompe ipsc-cms had comparable clearance rates of lc3-ii-detected autophagosomes. unexpectedly, the lysosome-associated membrane proteins, lamp1 and lamp2, from pompe ipsc-cms demonstrated higher electrophoretic mobility compared with control ipsc-cms. brefeldin a induced disruption of the golgi in control ipsc-cms reproduced the higher mobility forms of the lamps, suggesting that pompe ipsc-cms produce lamps lacking appropriate glycosylation. isoelectric focusing studies revealed that lamp2 has a more alkaline pi in pompe compared with control ipsc-cms due largely to hyposialylation. maldi-tof-ms analysis of n-linked glycans demonstrated reduced diversity of multiantennary structures and the major presence of a trimannose complex glycan precursor in pompe ipsc-cms. these data suggest that pompe cardiomyopathy has a glycan processing abnormality and thus shares features with hypertrophic cardiomyopathies observed in the congenital disorders of glycosylation.	-1
genetic heterogeneity of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in mexico.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) and familial defective apolipoprotein b-100 (fdb) are relatively common lipid disorders caused by mutations of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and apolipoprotein b (apob) genes, respectively. a third locus on chromosome 1p34.1-p32 was recently linked to fh and the responsible gene has been identified [protein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9)]. we assessed the contribution of the ldlr, apob, and pcsk9 genes as cause of fh in mexico. forty six unrelated probands, as well as 68 affected and 60 healthy relatives, were included. all index cases were diagnosed as having heterozygous autosomal dominant fh. seventeen of the 46 index cases had ldlr gene mutations, four of which were novel (fs92ter108, c268r, q718x, and fs736ter743); and only one patient had an apob mutation (r3500q). we sequenced the pcsk9 gene in the remainder of the 28 probands with no identified ldlr or apob gene defects; however, no pcsk9 mutations were found, including one large kindred with positive linkage to the 1p34.1-32 locus (multipoint lod score of 3.3) and two small pedigrees. linkage was excluded from these three loci in at least four kindreds suggesting that other yet uncharacterized genes are involved. our results underline substantial genetic heterogeneity for fh in the mexican population.	-1
autoimmunity, intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia, and defects in mucosal b-cell homeostasis in patients with pten hamartoma tumor syndrome.  the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (pten) regulates the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (pi3k)-akt signaling pathway. in a series of 34 patients with pten mutations, we described gastrointestinal lymphoid hyperplasia, extensive hyperplastic tonsils, thymus hyperplasia, autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and colitis. functional analysis of the gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue revealed increased signaling via the pi3k-akt pathway, including phosphorylation of s6 and increased cell proliferation, but also reduced apoptosis of cd20(+)cd10(+) b cells. reduced activity of pten therefore affects homeostasis of human germinal center b cells by increasing pi3k-akt signaling via mammalian target of rapamycin as well as antiapoptotic signals.	-1
two hot spot mutant p53 mouse models display differential gain of function in tumorigenesis.  mutant p53 proteins not only lose their tumor-suppressor function but some acquire oncogenic gain of function (gof). the published mutp53 knock-in (ki) alleles (r172h, r270h, r248w) manifest gof by broader tumor spectrum and more metastasis compared with the p53-null allele, but do not shorten survival. however, whether gof also occurs with other mutations and whether they are all biologically equal is unknown. to answer this, we created novel humanized mutp53 ki mice harboring the hot spot alleles r248q and g245s. intriguingly, their impact was very different. compared with p53-null mice, r248q/- mice had accelerated onset of all tumor types and shorter survival, thus unprecedented strong gof. in contrast, g245s/- mice were similar to null mice in tumor latency and survival. this was associated with a twofold higher t-lymphoma proliferation in r248q/- mice compared with g245s/- and null mice. moreover, r248q/- hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells were expanded relative to g245s/- and null mice, the first indication that gof also acts by perturbing pretumorous progenitor pools. importantly, these models closely mirror li-fraumeni patients who show higher tumor numbers, accelerated onset and shorter tumor-free survival by 10.5 years when harboring codon r248q mutations as compared with li-fraumeni patients with codon g245s mutations or p53 deletions/loss. conversely, both ki alleles caused a modest broadening of tumor spectrum with enhanced akt signaling compared with null mice. these models are the first in vivo proof for differential oncogenic strength among p53 gof alleles, with genotype-phenotype correlations borne out in humans.	1

mutation analysis of slc26a4 in mainland chinese patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  we have characterized the spectrum of slc26a4 mutations and clinical features in a population of mainland chinese patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) and enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva). cross-sectional clinical genetic study. tertiary care outpatient otolaryngology clinic. a total of 32 subjects identified with bilateral eva using high-resolution ct were screened for mutations in slc26a4 by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing methods. a total of 13 different mutations were identified in the slc26a4 gene, five of which are novel. a total of 88 percent of the patients harbored biallelic mutations, 11 patients were homozygotes, and 17 were compound heterozygotes. four patients were found to carry a single slc26a4 mutation. the ivs7-2a>g mutation was the most frequent, accounting for 60 percent of the mutant alleles. we have not found any correlations between the type of slc26a4 mutations and the type, degree, and progression of hearing loss. there are significant proportions of patients with asymmetric (26%), progressive (32%), or fluctuating hearing loss (21%). our data confirm the high prevalence of slc26a4 mutations in chinese patients with snhl and eva. we could not establish any relationship between genotype and phenotype. however, the high incidence of asymmetric, progressive, and fluctuating hearing loss found in the current study indicates that patients with those features should be routinely screened for slc26a4 mutation in addition to diagnosis of eva using ct or mri.	-1
bioinformatic analysis of gjb2 gene missense mutations.  gap junction beta 2 (gjb2) gene is the most commonly mutated connexin gene in patients with autosomal recessive and dominant hearing loss. according to ensembl (release 74) database, 1347 sequence variations are reported in the gjb2 gene and about 13.5% of them are categorized as missense snps or nonsynonymous variant. because of the high incidence of gjb2 mutations in hearing loss patients, revealing the molecular effect of gjb2 mutations on protein structure may also provide clear point of view regarding the molecular etiology of deafness. hence, the aim of this study is to analyze structural and functional consequences of all known gjb2 missense variations to the cx26 protein by applying multiple bioinformatics methods. two-hundred and eleven nonsynonymous variants were collected from ensembl release 74, leiden open variation database (lovd) and the human gene mutation database (hgmd). a number of bioinformatic tools were utilized for predicting the effect of gjb2 missense mutations at the sequence, structural, and functional levels. some of the mutations were found to locate highly conserved regions and have structural and functional properties. moreover, gjb2 mutations were also found to affect cx26 protein at the molecular level via loss or gain of disorder, catalytic site, and post-translational modifications, including methylation, glycosylation, and ubiquitination. findings, presented here, demonstrated the application of bioinformatic algorithms to predict the effects of mutations causing hearing impairment. i expect, this type of analysis will serve as a start point for future experimental evaluation of the gjb2 gene mutations and it will also be helpful in evaluating other deafness-related gene mutations.	1
diagnostic value of slc26a4 mutation status in hereditary hearing loss with eva: a prisma-compliant meta-analysis.  many slc26a4 mutations have been identified in patients with nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva). however, the roles of slc26a4 genotypes and phenotypes in hereditary deafness remain unexplained. this study aims to perform a meta-analysis based on the prisma statement to evaluate the diagnostic value of slc26a4 mutant alleles and their correlations with multiethnic hearing phenotypes in eva patients. the systematic literature search of the pubmed, wiley online library, embase, web of science, and science direct databases was conducted in english for articles published before july 15, 2015. two investigators independently reviewed retrieved literature and evaluated eligibility. discrepancy was resolved by discussion and a third investigator. quality of included studies was evaluated using newcastle-ottawa quality assessment scale. data were synthesized using random-effect or fixed-effect models. the effect sizes were estimated by measuring odds ratios (ors) with 95% confidence interval (ci). twenty-five eligible studies involved 2294 cases with eva data. a total of 272 slc26a4 variations were found in deafness with eva and 26 mutations of scl26a4 had higher frequency. the overall or was 646.71 (95% ci: 383.30-1091.15, p = 0.000). a total of 22 mutants were considered statistically significant in all ethnicities (ors >1, p < 0.05). in particular, 8 mutants were specificity of eva phenotypes in mutations of slc26a4 for asia deafness populations (ors >1, p < 0.05), 4 mutants for europe and north america (ors >1, p < 0.05), and the ivs7-2a>g mutations in slc26a4 were found to have the highest frequency in deafness individuals with eva phenotype (62.42%). moreover, subgroups for studies limited to cases with eva phenotype, 11 mutants relevant risks (rrs) were p < 0.05, especially for ivs7-2a>g bi-allelic mutants assayed in a deafness population (rr = 0.880, p = 0.000). diagnostic accuracy of slc26a4 mutation results also identified the significant association of ivs7-2a>g (auc = 0.99, 95% ci: 0.97-0.99) and p.h723r (auc = 0.99, 95% ci: 0.98-1.00) detecting deafness with eva. to conclude, the ivs7-2a>g and h723r in slc26a4 present a significant predicting value and discriminatory ability for clinical use on diagnosis of eva within a deafness population.	-1
molecular basis of the li-fraumeni syndrome: an update from the french lfs families.  we have performed an extensive analysis of tp53 in 474 french families suggestive of li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs), including 232 families fulfilling the chompret criteria. we identified a germline alteration of tp53 in 82 families (17%), in 67/232 of the families fulfilling the chompret criteria (29%) and in 15/242 which did not fulfil these criteria (6%). most of the alterations corresponded to missense mutations (67%), and we identified in four families genomic deletions removing the entire tp53 locus, the promoter and the non-coding exon 1, or exons 2-10. these results represent a definitive argument demonstrating that lfs results from tp53 haplodeficiency. the mean ages of tumour onset were significantly different between patients harbouring tp53 missense mutations and other types of alterations, missense mutations being associated with a 9 year earlier tumour onset. these results confirm that missense mutations not only inactivate p53 but also have an additional oncogenic effect. germline alterations of tp53 that lead exclusively to loss of function are therefore associated with a later age of tumour onset and the presence of such mutations should be considered in atypical lfs families with tumours diagnosed after 40 years.	-1
distinct disease phenotypes linked to different combinations of gaa mutations in a large late-onset gsdii sibship.  glycogenosis type ii (gsdii or pompe disease) is an autosomal recessive disease, often characterized by a progressive accumulation of glycogen within lysosomes caused by a deficiency of ?-1,4-glucosidase (gaa; acid maltase), a key enzyme of the glycogen degradation pathway. to date, more than 326 different mutations in the gaa gene have been identified in patients with gsdii but the course of the disease is difficult to be predicted on the basis of molecular genetic changes. studies on large informative families are advisable to better define how genetics and non genetics factors like exercise and diet may influence the clinical phenotype. in this study, we report on clinical, instrumental, and pathological features as well as on molecular analysis of a family with 10 out of 13 siblings affected by late-onset pompe disease. three mutations segregated in the family, two of which are novel mutations. siblings showing a more severe phenotype were compound heterozygous for c.118c > t [p.r40x] and c.2647-7g > a [p.n882fs] on gaa, whereas, two patients showing a mild phenotype were compound heterozygous c.2647-7g > a [p.n882fs] and c.2276g > c [p.g759a] mutations. quantitative expression analysis showed, in the patients carrying p.r40x/ p.n882fs, a significant (p 0.01) correlation between the levels of expression of the mutated allele and the age at onset of the disease. as far as we know, this is the largest informative family with late-onset pompe disease described in the literature showing a peculiar complex set of mutations of gaa gene that may partially elucidate the clinical heterogeneity of this family.	-1
novel gaa sequence variant c.1211 a>g reduces enzyme activity but not protein expression in infantile and adult onset pompe disease.  pompe disease is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder caused by lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency. we report on two affected members of a non-consanguineous caucasian family, including a classical infantile-onset patient with severe cardiomyopathy (io) and his paternal grandmother with the adult-onset (ao) form. two compound heterozygous sequence variants of the gaa gene were identified in each patient by mutation analyses (io=c.1211a>g and c.1798c>t; ao=c.1211a>g and c.692+5g>t). for this study, the biochemical phenotype resulting from the missense mutation c.1211a>g in exon 8, which converts a highly conserved aspartate to glycine (p.asp404gly), was of specific interest because it had not been reported previously. western blotting revealed a robust expression of all gaa isoforms in quadriceps muscle of both patients (fully crim positive), while enzymatic activity was 3.6% (io) and 6.6% (ao) of normal controls. to further validate these findings, the c.1211a>g sequence variant was introduced in wild type gaa cdna and over-expressed in hek293t cells. site-directed mutagenesis analyses confirmed that the mutation does not affect processing or expression of gaa protein, but rather impairs enzyme function. similar results were reported for c.1798c>t (p.arg600cys), which further supports the biochemical phenotype observed in io. the third mutation (c.692+5g>t, in intron 3) was predicted to affect normal splicing of the gaa mrna, and qpcr indeed verified a 4-fold lower mrna expression in ao. it is concluded that the novel sequence variant c.1211a>g results in full crim but significantly lower gaa activity, which in combination with c.1798c>t leads to infantile-onset pompe disease. we surmise that the difference in disease severity between the two family members in this study is due to a milder effect of the intronic mutation c.692+5g>t (vs. c.1798c>t) on phenotype, partially preserving gaa activity and delaying onset in the proband (paternal grandmother).	1
phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in south italy: genotype-phenotype correlations, identification of a novel mutant pah allele and prediction of bh4 responsiveness.  we investigated the mutation spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) in a cohort of patients from 33 italian pku families. mutational screening of the known coding region, including conventional intron splice sites, was performed by direct sequencing of the patients' genomic dna. thirty-three different disease causing mutations were identified in our patient group, including 19 missense, 6 splicing, 3 nonsense, 5 deletions, with a detection rate of 100%. the most prevalent mutation was the ivs10-11g>a, accounting for 12.1% of pku alleles studied. other frequent mutations were: p.r261q (9.1%), p.p281l (7.6%), and p.r408w (6.1%). we also identified one novel missense mutation, p.h290q. a spectrum of 31 different genotypes was observed and a genotype based predictions of bh4-responsiveness were assessed. among all genotypes, 13 were predicted to be bh4-responsive represented by thirteen pku families. in addition, genotype-phenotype correlations were performed. this study reveals the importance of a full genotyping of pku patients and the prediction of bh4-responsiveness, not only because of the definitive diagnosis and prediction of the optimal diet, but also to point out those patients that could benefit from new therapeutic approach. they may potentially benefit from bh4 therapy which, combined with a less strict diet, or eventually in special cases as monotherapy, may contribute to reduce nutritional deficiencies and minimize neurological and psychological dysfunctions.	-1
mutational spectrum of phenylketonuria in the chinese han population: a novel insight into the geographic distribution of the common mutations.  the absence of a comprehensive analysis for phenylketonuria (pku) mutations in the chinese han population has resulted in continued studies during the past 18 y to elucidate the mutational spectrum in patients from virtually all chinese regions. our study systematically investigated 13 exons and their surrounding introns of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene in 212 unrelated patients using pcr and direct sequencing. a total of 79 different mutations were identified in 405 of 424 mutant pah alleles including 15 novel ones. eight mutations, r243q, ex6-96a>g, ivs4 - 1g>a, r413p, y356x, r111x, r241c, and v399v, with a relative frequency of 3% or more, accounted for two thirds of the identified ones. the data presented in this study indicates that the total pool of mutant pah alleles in china consisted of a small number of common mutations and a very high number of rare mutations. moreover, by merging the findings of previous studies to generate a more composite data set for the chinese mainland, it is shown that there are no significant differences of the common mutations between southern and northern except for r413p statistically, raising questions about the previous hypothesis that great variations on mutation frequencies exist between above regions.	-1
grouping of multiple-lentigines/leopard and noonan syndromes on the ptpn11 gene.  multiple-lentigines (ml)/leopard (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic-conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition--characterized by lentigines and caf au lait spots, facial anomalies, cardiac defects--that shares several clinical features with noonan syndrome (ns). we screened nine patients with ml/leopard syndrome (including a mother-daughter pair) and two children with ns who had multiple caf au lait spots, for mutations in the ns gene, ptpn11, and found, in 10 of 11 patients, one of two new missense mutations, in exon 7 or exon 12. both mutations affect the ptpn11 phosphotyrosine phosphatase domain, which is involved in <30% of the ns ptpn11 mutations. the study demonstrates that ml/leopard syndrome and ns are allelic disorders. the detected mutations suggest that distinct molecular and pathogenetic mechanisms cause the peculiar cutaneous manifestations of the ml/leopard-syndrome subtype of ns.	-1
mutations of the gla gene in young patients with stroke: the portystroke study--screening genetic conditions in portuguese young stroke patients.  fabry disease is an x-linked monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the gla gene. recent data suggest that stroke in young adults may be associated with fabry disease. we aimed to ascertain the prevalence of this disorder among young adult patients with stroke in portugal by gla genotyping. during 1 year, all patients aged 18 to 55 years with first-ever stroke, who were admitted into any of 12 neurology hospital departments in portugal, were prospectively enrolled (n=625). ischemic stroke was classified according to trial of org 10172 in acute stroke treatment criteria. alpha-galactosidase activity was further assayed in all patients with gla mutations. four hundred ninety-three patients (mean age, 45.4 years; 61% male) underwent genetic analyses: 364 with ischemic stroke, 89 with intracerebral hemorrhage, 26 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 14 with cerebral venous thrombosis. twelve patients had missense gla mutations: 9 with ischemic stroke (p.r118c: n=4; p.d313y: n=5), including 5 patients with an identified cause of stroke (cardiac embolism: n=2; small vessel disease: n=2; other cause: n=1), 2 with intracerebral hemorrhage (p.r118c: n=1; p.d313y: n=1), and one with cerebral venous thrombosis (p.r118c: n=1). leukocyte alpha-galactosidase activity was subnormal in the hemizygous males and subnormal or low-normal in the heterozygous females. estimated prevalence of missense gla mutations was 2.4% (95% ci, 1.3% to 4.1%). despite a low diagnostic yield, screening for gla mutations should probably be considered in different types of stroke. restricting investigation to patients with cryptogenic stroke may underestimate the true prevalence of fabry disease in young patients with stroke.	-1
multigene panels in ashkenazi jewish patients yield high rates of actionable mutations in multiple non-brca cancer-associated genes.  to evaluate the results of multigene panel testing among ashkenazi jewish compared with non-ashkenazi jewish patients. we reviewed the medical records for all patients who underwent multigene panel testing and targeted brca1/2 testing at a single institution between 6/2013-1/2015. clinical actionability for identified pathogenic mutations was characterized based on the national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) guidelines and consensus statements and expert opinion for genes not addressed by these guidelines. four hundred and fifty-four patients underwent multigene panel screening, including 138 ashkenazi jewish patients. the median patient age was fifty-two years. three hundred and fifty-four patients (78%) had a personal history of cancer. two hundred and fifty-one patients had breast cancer, 49, ovarian cancer, 26, uterine cancer and 20, colorectal cancer. we identified 62 mutations in 56 patients and 291 variants of uncertain significance in 196 patients. among the 56 patients with mutations, 51 (91%) had actionable mutations. twenty mutations were identified by multigene panels among ashkenazi jewish patients, 18 of which were in genes other than brca1/2. a review of targeted brca1/2 testing performed over the same study period included 103 patients and identified six mutations in brca1/2, all of which occurred in ashkenazi jewish patients. among all ashkenazi jewish patients undergoing genetic testing, 25/183 (14%) had a mutation, 24/25 of which were actionable (96%) and 17/25 patients (68%) had mutations in non brca1/2 genes. with the rapid acceptance of multigene panels there is a pressing need to understand how this testing will affect patient management. while traditionally many ashkenazi jewish patients have undergone targeted brca1/2 testing, our data suggest consideration of multigene panels in this population as the majority of the results are clinically actionable and often in genes other than brca1/2.	-1
evaluation of the molecular mechanisms involved in the gain of function of a li-fraumeni tp53 mutation.  the tp53 tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent target for genetic alterations in human cancer. tp53 gene alterations may result in the gain of oncogenic functions such as neoangiogenesis and resistance to therapy. the tp53 germ line mutation c.659a>c (p.y220s) was identified in stored dna from related patients with li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) who died after developing clinically aggressive tumors. all of the patients were treated with protocols that included doxorubicin hydrochloride (dx) as a pivotal drug. to define the in vitro mutational phenotype of this germ line mutation, we used murine fibroblasts explanted from wild-type (wt) and p53 knockout (ko) mice from the same littermate. p53y220s and p53r175h fibroblasts, obtained from p53ko fibroblasts transfected with expression vectors encoding the human y220s and r175h p53 mutants, respectively, exhibited resistance to dx treatment. moreover, p53y220s fibroblasts exhibited angiogenetic properties, and after dx treatment, p53y220s failed to translocate into the nucleus and showed an increase in its cytosolic levels. dx treatment does not influence p53 distribution within the nuclear and cytosolic compartments in p53r175h fibroblasts. peroxiredoxin ii (prx ii), a protein that is involved in eliminating reactive oxygen species (ros), showed increased expression intensity in p53y220s fibroblasts after dx treatment, as observed by two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis. moreover, thioredoxin (trx), a protein that cooperates with prx ii, is overexpressed in p53y220s mutants under basal conditions. these data suggest a relationship between the presence of the p53y220s mutation and enhanced levels of prx ii and trx in mutant fibroblasts. since one of the mechanisms of the dx antitumor effect has been ascribed to production of ros, future studies will evaluate the involvement of prxii and trx in the chemoresistance of p53y220s fibroblasts to dx.	-1
"genotype-phenotype correlation in pompe disease, a step forward.  pompe's disease is a progressive myopathy caused by mutations in the lysosomal enzyme acid alphaglucosidase gene (gaa). a wide clinical variability occurs also in patients sharing the same gaa mutations, even within the same family. for a large series of gsdii patients we collected some clinical data as age of onset of the disease, presence or absence of muscular pain, walton score, 6-minute walking test, vital capacity, and creatine kinase. dna was extracted and tested for gaa mutations and some genetic polymorphisms able to influence muscle properties (ace, actn3, agt and ppar? genes).we compared the polymorphisms analyzed in groups of patients with pompe disease clustered for their homogeneous genotype. we have been able to identify four subgroups of patients completely homogeneous for their genotype, and two groups homogeneous as far as the second mutation is defined ""very severe"" or ""potentially less severe"". when disease free life was studied we observed a high significant difference between groups. the dd genotype in the ace gene and the xx genotype in the actn3 gene were significantly associated to an earlier age of onset of the disease. the ace dd genotype was also associated to the presence of muscle pain. we demonstrate that ace and actn3 polymorphisms are genetic factors able to modulate the clinical phenotype of patients affected with pompe disease."	1
activation of mapk by inverse agonists in six naturally occurring constitutively active mutant human melanocortin-4 receptors.  the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) is a g protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in regulating energy homeostasis. defects in mc4r are the most common monogenic form of obesity, with about 170 distinct mutations identified in human. in addition to the conventional gs-stimulated adenylyl cyclase pathway, it has been recently demonstrated that mc4r also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (erk1/2). herein, we investigated the potential of four mc4r ligands that are inverse agonists at the gs-camp signaling pathway, including agouti-related peptide (agrp), mcl0020, ipsen 5i and ml00253764, to regulate erk1/2 activation (perk1/2) in wild type and six naturally occurring constitutively active mutant (cam) mc4rs. we showed that these four inverse agonists acted as agonists for the erk1/2 signaling cascade in wild type and cam mc4rs. three mutants (p230l, l250q and f280l) had significantly increased perk1/2 level upon stimulation with all four inverse agonists, with maximal induction ranging from 1.6 to 4.2-fold. d146n had significantly increased perk1/2 level upon stimulation with agrp, mcl0020 or ml00253764, but not ipsen 5i. the perk1/2 levels of h76r and s127l were significantly increased only upon stimulation with agrp or mcl0020. in summary, our studies demonstrated for the first time that mc4r inverse agonists at the gs-camp pathway could serve as agonists in the mapk pathway. these results suggested that there were multiple activation states of mc4r with ligand-specific and/or mutant-specific conformations capable of differentially coupling the mc4r to distinct signaling pathways.	1
identification of 21 novel glucokinase (gck) mutations in uk and european caucasians with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody).  maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) resulting from mutations in the glucokinase (gck) gene accounts for approximately 20% of mody in the uk. we have performed fluorescent single stranded conformation polymorphism (f-sscp) analysis or direct sequencing of the gck gene in 212 patients referred as part of a research cohort or for diagnostic molecular genetic testing. mutation screening has identified 43 different mutations in 61 individuals, of which 21 are novel. this report details the mutations identified and their associated clinical features.	-1
a pro51ser mutation in the coch gene is associated with late onset autosomal dominant progressive sensorineural hearing loss with vestibular defects.  we analysed a dutch family with autosomal dominant non-syndromic progressive sensorineural hearing loss and mapped the underlying gene defect by genetic linkage analysis to a 11.0 cm region overlapping the dfna9 interval on chromosome 14q12-q13. clinically, the dutch family differs from the original dfna9 family by a later age at onset and a more clearly established vestibular impairment. a gene that is highly and specifically expressed in the human fetal cochlea and vestibule, coch (previously described as coch5b2 ), was mapped to the dfna9 critical region. sequence analysis revealed a 208c-->t mutation in the coch gene, resulting in a pro51ser substitution in the predicted protein in all affected individuals of the family but not in unaffected family members and 200 control individuals. the same mutation was also identified in three apparently unrelated families with a similar phenotype, suggesting the presence of a dutch founder mutation. the function of coch is unknown but several characteristics of the protein point to a structural role in the extracellular matrix. the mutant serine at position 51 is situated between cysteines and possibly interferes with proper coch protein folding or its interaction with extracellular matrix proteins.	-1
detecting multiple lysosomal storage diseases by tandem mass spectrometry--a national newborn screening program in taiwan.  interest in lysosomal storage diseases in newborn screening programs has increased in recent years. two techniques, fluorescence (4-mu) and tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) methods are frequently used. we report a pilot study of large scale newborn screening for fabry, pompe, gaucher, and mps i diseases by using the ms/ms method in taiwan and compared the performance of the ms/ms with 4-mu methods. more than 100,000 dried blood spots (dbss) were collected consecutively as part of the national taiwan newborn screening programs. the enzyme activities were detected by the ms/ms method from a dbs punch. mutation analysis was further performed for newborns with detected enzyme deficiency. the dna sequence analysis for suspected cases revealed 64 newborns with confirmed fabry mutations, 16 were classified as infantile or late-onset pompe disease, and 1 was characterized as gaucher disease. the positive predict value increased from 4.0% to 7.1% in the pompe study, and from 61.0% to 95.5% in the fabry study by the ms/ms method compared to 4-mu assay. the ms/ms method has been validated as a more specific, powerful and efficient tool than the 4-mu assay. it also provided a multiplex solution of newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases.	-1
a comparison of whole genome sequencing to multigene panel testing in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients.  as dna sequencing costs decline, genetic testing options have expanded. whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (wgs) are entering clinical use, posing questions about their incremental value compared with disease-specific multigene panels that have been the cornerstone of genetic testing. forty-one patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had undergone targeted hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genetic testing (either multigene panel or familial variant test) were recruited into the medseq project, a clinical trial of wgs. results from panel genetic testing and wgs were compared. in 20 of 41 participants, panel genetic testing identified variants classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or uncertain significance. wgs identified 19 of these 20 variants, but the variant detection algorithm missed a pathogenic 18 bp duplication in myosin binding protein c (mybpc3) because of low coverage. in 3 individuals, wgs identified variants in genes implicated in cardiomyopathy but not included in prior panel testing: a pathogenic protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (ptpn11) variant and variants of uncertain significance in integrin-linked kinase (ilk) and filamin-c (flnc). wgs also identified 84 secondary findings (mean=2 per person, range=0-6), which mostly defined carrier status for recessive conditions. wgs detected nearly all variants identified on panel testing, provided 1 new diagnostic finding, and allowed interrogation of posited disease genes. several variants of uncertain clinical use and numerous secondary genetic findings were also identified. whereas panel testing and wgs provided similar diagnostic yield, wgs offers the advantage of reanalysis over time to incorporate advances in knowledge, but requires expertise in genomic interpretation to appropriately incorporate wgs into clinical care. url: https://clinicaltrials.gov. unique identifier: nct01736566.	-1
bh4-sensitive hyperphenylalaninemia: new case and review of literature.  we report a patient with bh(4)-sensitive phenylketonuria. in neonatal screening, phenylalanine levels above 10 mg/dl were detected. in the tetrahydrobiopterin- (bh(4)) loading test, phenylalanine concentrations in serum fell significantly. dihydropteridine reductase activity in blood, pterines, and neurotransmitters in cerebrospinal fluid, as well as pterines in urine were all normal. mutation analysis revealed compound-heterozygosity for the mutations r408w and k320n. under bh(4)-supplementation without a specific phenylalanine-reduced diet, phenylalanine-concentrations are in the therapeutic range and our patient developed normally.	-1
mutations in sarcomere protein genes as a cause of dilated cardiomyopathy.  the molecular basis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, a primary myocardial disorder that results in reduced contractile function, is largely unknown. some cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy are caused by mutations in cardiac cytoskeletal proteins; this finding implicates defects in contractile-force transmission as one mechanism underlying this disorder. to elucidate this important cause of heart failure, we investigated other genetic causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. clinical evaluations were performed in 21 kindreds with familial dilated cardiomyopathy. a genome-wide linkage study prompted a search of the genes encoding beta-myosin heavy chain, troponin t, troponin i, and alpha-tropomyosin for disease-causing mutations. a genetic locus for mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy was identified at chromosome 14q11.2-13 (maximal lod score, 5.11; theta=0), where the gene for cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain is encoded. analyses of this and other genes for sarcomere proteins identified disease-causing dominant mutations in four kindreds. cardiac beta-myosin heavy-chain missense mutations (ser532pro and phe764leu) and a deletion in cardiac troponin t (deltalys210) caused early-onset ventricular dilatation (average age at diagnosis, 24 years) and diminished contractile function and frequently resulted in heart failure. affected persons had neither antecedent cardiac hypertrophy (average maximal left-ventricular-wall thickness, 8.5 mm) nor histopathological findings characteristic of hypertrophy. mutations in sarcomere protein genes account for approximately 10 percent of cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and are particularly prevalent in families with early-onset ventricular dilatation and dysfunction. because distinct mutations in sarcomere proteins cause either dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the effects of mutant sarcomere proteins on muscle mechanics must trigger two different series of events that remodel the heart.	-1

structure/function studies of human beta-cell glucokinase. enzymatic properties of a sequence polymorphism, mutations associated with diabetes, and other site-directed mutants.  glucokinase plays a key role in the regulation of glucose metabolism in insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells and in the liver. recent studies have shown that mutations in this enzyme can lead to the development of a form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus that is characterized by an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and onset during childhood. here, we report the catalytic properties of five additional missense mutations associated with diabetes (glu70-->lys, ser131-->pro, ala188-->thr, trp257-->arg and lys414-->glu), one polymorphism present in both normal and diabetic subjects (asp4-->asn), and three site-directed mutations (glu177-->lys, glu256-->ala, and lys414-->ala). the trp257-->arg mutation generated an enzyme that had an activity that was less than 0.5% of that for native human beta-cell glucokinase. by contrast, the glu70-->lys, ser131-->pro, ala188-->thr, and lys414-->glu mutations had a vmax that was 20-100% of normal but a km for glucose that was 8-14-fold greater than the native enzyme. there was no effect of the asp4-->asn polymorphism or the glu177-->lys substitution on glucokinase activity. the lys414-->ala substitution had no effect on vmax but increased the km for glucose 2-fold and the glu256-->ala substitution caused a approximately 200-fold decrease in vmax. these studies have led to the identification of additional residues involved in glucokinase catalysis and substrate binding.	1
"genomic analysis of inherited breast cancer among palestinian women: genetic heterogeneity and a founder mutation in tp53.  breast cancer among palestinian women has lower incidence than in europe or north america, yet is very frequently familial. we studied genetic causes of this familial clustering in a consecutive hospital-based series of 875 palestinian patients with invasive breast cancer, including 453 women with diagnosis by age 40, or with breast or ovarian cancer in a mother, sister, grandmother or aunt (""discovery series""); and 422 women diagnosed after age 40 and with negative family history (""older-onset sporadic patient series""). genomic dna from women in the discovery series was sequenced for all known breast cancer genes, revealing a pathogenic mutation in 13% (61/453) of patients. these mutations were screened in all patients and in 300 palestinian female controls, revealing 1.0% (4/422) carriers among older, nonfamilial patients and two carriers among controls. the mutational spectrum was highly heterogeneous, including pathogenic mutations in 11 different genes: brca1, brca2, tp53, atm, chek2, bard1, brip1, palb2, mre11a, pten and xrcc2. brca1 carriers were significantly more likely than other patients to have triple negative tumors (p = 0.03). the single most frequent mutation was tp53 p.r181c, which was significantly enriched in the discovery series compared to controls (p = 0.01) and was responsible for 15% of breast cancers among young onset or familial patients. tp53 p.r181c predisposed specifically to breast cancer with incomplete penetrance, and not to other li-fraumeni cancers. palestinian women with young onset or familial breast cancer and their families would benefit from genetic analysis and counseling."	-1
molecular genetic analysis of familial hypercholesterolemia: spectrum and regional difference of ldl receptor gene mutations in japanese population.  to determine the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) in japan, 200 unrelated patients with clinically diagnosed heterozygous fh were screened for mutations in coding and promoter region of the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor gene using denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis (dgge), dna sequencing and southern blotting analysis. about 37 different mutations in the ldl receptor gene were identified in 125 (62.5%) of the patients, 22 of these mutations have not been described before. the most common mutations were k790x (19.5%), p664l (6.0%), fh-tonami-1 (6.0%), ivs15-3c>a (5.5%) and fh-tonami-2 (4.5%), whereas the other mutations were rare. no apolipoprotein b (apob) mutations responsible for familial ligand-defective apob-100 (fdb) were identified. polymorphisms of apolipoprotein e (apoe) and scavenger receptor class b type i (sr-bi) were observed to have minor effects on the lipid and lipoprotein profile. in 75 (32.5%) of the fh patients, ldl receptor gene mutations could not be identified. these patients had significantly lower total cholesterol (7.71+/-1.64 vs. 8.68+/-1.47 mmol/l, p<0.001) and ldl-cholesterol (6.02+/-1.51 vs. 6.87+/-1.47 mmol/l, p<0.001) in plasma, also a lower incidence of coronary heart disease (chd) (22 vs. 29%, p=0.05) compared with patients with a ldl receptor gene mutation, suggesting that besides ldl receptor, defect of other genes involved in ldl metabolism may be a cause of fh with a milder phenotypic expression in japanese population.	-1
p53 compound heterozygosity in a severely affected child with li-fraumeni syndrome.  the li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is a rare, dominantly inherited syndrome that features high risk of cancers in childhood and early adulthood. affected families tend to develop bone and soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancers, brain tumors, leukemias, and adrenocortical carcinomas. in some kindreds, the genetic abnormality associated with this cancer phenotype is a heterozygous germline mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. recently, we identified one patient who presented in early childhood with multiple primary cancers and who harbored three germline p53 alterations (r156h and r267q on the maternal allele and r290h on the paternal allele). to classify the biologic effects of these alterations, functional properties of each of the p53 mutants were examined using in vitro assays of cellular growth suppression and transcriptional activation. each amino acid substitution conferred partial or complete loss of wild-type p53 function, but the child completed normal embryonic development. this observation has not been previously reported in a human, but is consistent with observations of normal embryogenesis in p53-deficient mice.	1
"a method to select for mutator dna polymerase deltas in saccharomyces cerevisiae.  proofreading dna polymerases share common short peptide motifs that bind mg(2+) in the exonuclease active center; however, hydrolysis rates are not the same for all of the enzymes, which indicates that there are functional and likely structural differences outside of the conserved residues. since structural information is available for only a few proofreading dna polymerases, we developed a genetic selection method to identify mutant alleles of the pol3 gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encode dna polymerase delta mutants that replicate dna with reduced fidelity. the selection procedure is based on genetic methods used to identify ""mutator"" dna polymerases in bacteriophage t4. new yeast dna polymerase delta mutants were identified, but some mutants expected from studies of the phage t4 dna polymerase were not detected. this would indicate that there may be important differences in the proofreading pathways catalyzed by the two dna polymerases."	1
gjb2 mutation spectrum in 2,063 chinese patients with nonsyndromic hearing impairment.  mutations in gjb2 are the most common molecular defects responsible for autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment (nshi). the mutation spectra of this gene vary among different ethnic groups. in order to understand the spectrum and frequency of gjb2 mutations in the chinese population, the coding region of the gjb2 gene from 2063 unrelated patients with nshi was pcr amplified and sequenced. a total of 23 pathogenic mutations were identified. among them, five (p.w3x, c.99delt, c.155_c.158deltctg, c.512_c.513insaacg, and p.y152x) are novel. three hundred and seven patients carry two confirmed pathogenic mutations, including 178 homozygotes and 129 compound heterozygotes. one hundred twenty five patients carry only one mutant allele. thus, gjb2 mutations account for 17.9% of the mutant alleles in 2063 nshi patients. overall, 92.6% (684/739) of the pathogenic mutations are frame-shift truncation or nonsense mutations. the four prevalent mutations; c.235delc, c.299_c.300delat, c.176_c.191del16, and c.35delg, account for 88.0% of all mutantalleles identified. the frequency of gjb2 mutations (alleles) varies from 4% to 30.4% among different regions of china. it also varies among different sub-ethnic groups. in some regions of china, testing of the three most common mutations can identify at least one gjb2 mutant allele in all patients. in other regions such as tibet, the three most common mutations account for only 16% the gjb2 mutant alleles. thus, in this region, sequencing of gjb2 would be recommended. in addition, the etiology of more than 80% of the mutant alleles for nshi in china remains to be identified. analysis of other nshi related genes will be necessary.	-1
prevalence of deafness-associated connexin-26 (gjb2) and connexin-30 (gjb6) pathogenic alleles in a large patient cohort from eastern sicily.  mutations in the gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26 (gjb2) and connexin 30 (gjb6) have been shown to be a major contributor to prelingual, sensorineural, nonsyndromic deafness. the aim of this study was to characterize and establish the prevalence of gjb2 and gjb6 gene alterations in 196 patients affected by sensorineural, nonsyndromic hearing loss, from eastern sicily. we performed sequence analysis of gjb2 and identified sequence variants in 68 out of 196 patients (34.7%); (28 homozygous for c.35delg, 22 compound heterozygous and 11 with only one variant allele). we found 12 different allelic variants, the most prevalent being c.35delg, which was found on 89 chromosomes (65.5%), followed by other alleles with different frequencies (p.e47x, c.-23+1g>a, p.l90p, p.r184w, p.m34t, c.167delt, p.r127h, p.m163v, p.v153i, p.w24x, and p.t8m). importantly, for the first time we present the frequency and spectrum of gjb2 mutations in nshl patients from eastern sicily. no alterations were found in the gjb6 gene, confirming that alterations in this gene are uncommon in our geographic area. note that 65.3% and 23.5% of our patients, respectively were found to be negative or carriers by gjb2 molecular screening. this emphasizes the need to broaden the genetic analysis to other genes involved in hearing loss.	-1
medical sequencing at the extremes of human body mass.  body weight is a quantitative trait with significant heritability in humans. to identify potential genetic contributors to this phenotype, we resequenced the coding exons and splice junctions of 58 genes in 379 obese and 378 lean individuals. our 96-mb survey included 21 genes associated with monogenic forms of obesity in humans or mice, as well as 37 genes that function in body weight-related pathways. we found that the monogenic obesity-associated gene group was enriched for rare nonsynonymous variants unique to the obese population compared with the lean population. in addition, computational analysis predicted a greater fraction of deleterious variants within the obese cohort. together, these data suggest that multiple rare alleles contribute to obesity in the population and provide a medical sequencing-based approach to detect them.	-1
twenty novel mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene causing fabry disease.  fabry disease, an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal exoglycohydrolase alpha-galactosidase a (ec 3.2.1.22; alpha-gal a). the nature of the molecular lesions in the alpha-gal a gene in 30 unrelated families was determined to provide precise heterozygote detection, prenatal diagnosis, and define genotype-phenotype correlations. genomic dna was isolated from affected males and/or carrier females from 30 unrelated families with fabry disease. the entire alpha-gal a coding region and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed by pcr amplification and automated sequencing. twenty new mutations were identified, each in a single family: c142r, g183d, s235c, w236l, d244h, p259l, m267i, i289f, q321e, c378y, c52x, w277x, ivs4(+4), ivs6(+2), ivs6(-1), 35del13, 256del1, 892ins1, 1176del4, and 1188del1. in the remaining 10 unrelated fabry families, 9 previously reported mutations were detected: m42v, r112c, s148r, d165v, n215s (in 2 families), q99x, c142x, r227x, and 1072del3. haplotype analysis using markers closely flanking the alpha-gal a gene indicated that the two patients with the n215s lesion were unrelated. the ivs4(+4) mutation was a rare intronic splice site mutation that causes fabry disease. these studies further define the heterogeneity of mutations in the alpha-gal a gene causing fabry disease, permit precise heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis, and help delineate phenotype-genotype correlations in this disease. </ab	-1
retrospective study of prenatal ultrasound findings in newborns with a noonan spectrum disorder.  noonan spectrum disorders (nsds) occur in 1:1000-2500 live births. currently, there are no guidelines for prenatal molecular genetic testing for nsds. recent studies recommend prenatal testing for nsds when ultrasonography detects two or more associated abnormalities. a stronger association between ultrasound findings and nsds would enable more informed prenatal genetic testing. a total of 212 newborns (0-12 weeks) with prenatal ultrasound findings and a clinical suspicion of a nsd were referred for molecular genetic testing. of these, 159/212 newborns tested had a single ultrasound abnormality and 53/212 newborns had two or more. testing was performed by either a microarray-based resequencing assay or next generation sequencing of ras/mapk pathway genes associated with nsds. prenatal ultrasound findings in positive and negative cases were compared. a disease-causing variant was identified in 21.7% (46/212) of newborns tested. of these positive cases, 67.4% (31/46) had only one ultrasound abnormality reported. the rate of detecting a disease-causing variant in cases with one ultrasound finding was 19.5% (31/159), which was not significantly different (p-value = 0.36) than that in cases with two or more ultrasound findings (28.3%; 15/53). prenatal molecular testing for nsds should be considered even in the presence of a single associated abnormal ultrasound finding.  2016 john wiley & sons, ltd.	-1
molecular epidemiology and bh4-responsiveness in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency from galicia region of spain.  knowledge of hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) mutational spectrum in a population allows in many cases an accurate prediction of the phenotype and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsiveness, thus selecting an adequate treatment. in this work, we have performed the molecular characterization of 105 hpa patients from galicia, in the northwest region of spain, evaluating their phenotype and bh4 response. the mutational spectrum analysis showed 47 distinct mutations in 89 families, 37 of them (78.7%) corresponding to missense mutations. six mutations account for 47.2% of all the investigated alleles, each one with a frequency ? 5% (ivs10-11g>a, p.r261q, p.v388m, p.r176l, p.e280k, p.a300s). the most prevalent hpa mutations in galicia are the common mediterranean mutation ivs10-11g>a and p.r261q, with frequencies of 13.8% and 10.5%, respectively. one novel mutation (p.k361q; c.1081a>c) was also reported. although a good genotype-phenotype correlation is observed, there is no exact correlation for some genotypes involving mutations p.r261q, p.i65t or ivs10-11g>a. forty seven patients were monitored for post-challenge bh4, establishing genotype-based predictions of bh4-responsiveness in all of them. all phenylketonuric patients with 2 nonresponsive mutations were unresponsive to bh4 and patients with mutations previously associated with bh4 responsiveness in the two alleles had a clear positive response to the test, with the exception of 5 patients with mutations p.r261q, p.i65t and p.r68s. our study supports a similar degree of heterogeneity of the hpa mutation spectrum in galicia compared to reported data from southern europe. patients carrying null mutations in both alleles showed the highest degree of concordance with the most severe phenotypes. genotype is a good predictor of bh4 response.	-1

comprehensive rare variant analysis via whole-genome sequencing to determine the molecular pathology of inherited retinal disease.  inherited retinal disease is a common cause of visual impairment and represents a highly heterogeneous group of conditions. here, we present findings from a cohort of 722 individuals with inherited retinal disease, who have had whole-genome sequencing (n = 605), whole-exome sequencing (n = 72), or both (n = 45) performed, as part of the nihr-bioresource rare diseases research study. we identified pathogenic variants (single-nucleotide variants, indels, or structural variants) for 404/722 (56%) individuals. whole-genome sequencing gives unprecedented power to detect three categories of pathogenic variants in particular: structural variants, variants in gc-rich regions, which have significantly improved coverage compared to whole-exome sequencing, and variants in non-coding regulatory regions. in addition to previously reported pathogenic regulatory variants, we have identified a previously unreported pathogenic intronic variant in chm in two males with choroideremia. we have also identified 19 genes not previously known to be associated with inherited retinal disease, which harbor biallelic predicted protein-truncating variants in unsolved cases. whole-genome sequencing is an increasingly important comprehensive method with which to investigate the genetic causes of inherited retinal disease.	-1
pten in colorectal cancer: a report on two cowden syndrome patients.  heterozygous germline pten mutations cause cowden syndrome. the risk of colorectal cancer in cowden patients, however, remains a matter of debate. we describe two patients presenting with colorectal cancer at a young age (28 and 39 years) and dysmorphisms fitting the cowden spectrum. heterozygous germline mutations in pten were found in both patients. moreover, analysis of the resected colorectal cancer specimens revealed loss of heterozygosity at the pten locus with retention of the mutated alleles, and greatly reduced or absent pten expression. histologically and molecularly, the tumours showed resemblance with sporadic colorectal cancers, although they had prominent fibrotic stroma. our data indicate that pten loss was involved in carcinogenesis in the two patients, supporting that colorectal cancer is part of the cowden syndrome-spectrum. this is in line with data on sporadic colorectal cancer, mice studies and emerging epidemiological data on cowden syndrome. although the exact role of germline pten mutations in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer remains unclear, we think that cowden syndrome should be in the differential diagnosis of colorectal cancer certainly in view of the possible prognostic and therapeutic consequences. prospective follow-up and surveillance of pten mutation carriers from the age of 25 to 30 years in a study setting should clarify this issue.	-1
genetic analysis of 2299delg and c759f mutations (ush2a) in patients with visual and/or auditory impairments.  the most common mutation in the ush2a gene (usherin), 2299delg, causes both typical usher (ush) syndrome type ii and atypical ush syndrome, two autosomal recessive disorders, characterised by moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa (rp). furthermore, the c759f mutation in the ush2a gene has been described in 4.5% of patients with nonsyndromic recessive rp. we have investigated the presence of the 2299delg and/or the c759f mutations in 191 unrelated spanish patients with different syndromic and nonsyndromic retinal diseases, or with nonsyndromic hearing impairment. the 2299delg mutation was observed in patients with clinical signs of ushii or of atypical ush syndrome, whereas the c759f mutation, regardless of being associated with the 2299delg mutation or not, was identified in cases with nonsyndromic rp, as well as in patients with rp associated with a variability of hearing impairment. the comparative analysis of both phenotypic and genotypic data supports the hypothesis that sensorineural hearing loss in patients with rp may depend on the nature and on the association of the ush2a allele variants present.	-1
mutation spectrum of phenylketonuria in syrian population: genotype-phenotype correlation.  characterization of the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (pku) in syria has been accomplished through the analysis of 78 unrelated chromosomes from 39 syrian patients with pku. phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations have been analyzed by using molecular detection methods based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), artificial constructed restriction sites (acrs) pcr and direct dna sequencing. 56.4% of the patients had cpku. a mutation detection rate of 79.49% was achieved and sixteen different mutations were found: missense 56.25%, splice site 37.5%, and frameshift 6.25%. the predominant mutation in this population sample was p.r261q g>a, p.f55>lfs and p.r243q g>a. no mutation in six pku patients was observed. in 57.9% of patient genotypes, the metabolic phenotype could be predicted. the identification of the mutations in the pah gene and the genotype-phenotype correlation should facilitate the evaluation of metabolic phenotypes, diagnosis, implementation of optimal dietary therapy, and determination of prognosis in the patients and genetic counseling for the patient's relatives.	-1

biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline tp53 mutation carriers with li-fraumeni syndrome: a prospective observational study.  individuals with li-fraumeni syndrome have a high lifetime risk of developing cancer. we assessed the feasibility and potential clinical effect of a comprehensive surveillance protocol in asymptomatic tp53 mutation carriers in families with this syndrome. we implemented a clinical surveillance protocol, using frequent biochemical and imaging studies, for asymptomatic tp53 mutation carriers on jan 1, 2004, and did a prospective observational study of members of eight families with li-fraumeni syndrome who either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. the primary outcome measure was detection of new cancers. the secondary outcome measure was overall survival. as of nov 1, 2010, 33 tp53 mutation carriers were identified, 18 of whom underwent surveillance. the surveillance protocol detected ten asymptomatic tumours in seven patients, including small, high-grade tumours and low-grade or premalignant tumours. all seven mutation carriers were alive after a median follow-up of 24 months (iqr 22-65 months). 12 high-grade, high-stage tumours developed in 10 individuals in the non-surveillance group, two of whom (20%) were alive at the end of follow-up (p=00417 for comparison with survival in the surveillance group). 3-year overall survival was 100% in the surveillance group and 21% (95% ci 4-48%) in the non-surveillance group (p=00155). our findings show the feasibility of a clinical surveillance protocol for the detection of asymptomatic neoplasms in individuals with germline tp53 mutations. this strategy offers a management option for affected individuals, and its benefits lend support to the use of early genetic testing of at-risk individuals and families. canadian cancer society research institute, canadian institutes of health research, sickkids foundation, and soccer for hope.	-1
ten novel mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) observed in brazilian patients with phenylketonuria.  in the present study we report on the identification of ten novel mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene of brazilian patients with phenylketonuria (pku): ivs5-54a>g, ivs6+17g>t, e205a, f240s, k274e, i318t, l321l, c357g, ivs11+17g>a and s411x. these mutations were detected during the characterization of the pah genotypes of 115 patients with pku from the southeast region of brazil. the results obtained confirm the high heterogeneity of the pah gene and provide information about the distribution of pku mutations in the brazilian population.	-1
development of a feasible assay for the detection of gaa mutations in patients with pompe disease.  pompe disease is an inherited autosomal recessive deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) and is due to pathogenic sequence variants in the corresponding gaa gene. while the analysis of enzyme activity remains the diagnostic test of choice for individuals with pompe disease, mutation analysis remains for establishing a definitive diagnosis. high resolution melting (hrm) analysis was performed to screen gaa mutations. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral blood samples of the two patients with pompe disease and 250 normal controls. exons 2 through 20 of the gaa gene were screened by the hrm analysis. the results were subsequently confirmed by direct sequencing. this assay proved to be feasible in detecting seven known (c.2t>c, c.1726g>a, c.1845g>a, c.1935c>a, c.1958c>a, c.2238g>c, and c.2815_2816del) gaa mutations. each mutation could be readily and accurately identified in the difference plot curves. we estimated the carrier frequency of the most common mutation, c.1935g>a (p.d645e), in the taiwanese population to be 0.2%. in clinical practice, we suggest that hrm analysis is assumed as a fast and reliable method for screening gaa gene mutations especially the most common mutations which are responsible for pompe disease among the taiwanese populations.	-1
fabry disease: renal sonographic and magnetic resonance imaging findings in affected males and carrier females with the classic and cardiac variant phenotypes.  to describe the renal ultrasonography (us) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) findings in affected males and female carriers with the classic and cardiac variant phenotypes of fabry disease (alpha-galactosidase a [alpha-gal a] deficiency). the renal us and mri features of 76 classically affected males (aged 7-53 years), 40 female carriers from classically affected families (aged 18-66 years), and 6 males with the cardiac variant phenotype (aged 17-59 years) were reviewed by 3 blinded board-certified radiologists. the images were evaluated for the presence of cortical cysts, parapelvic cysts, renal atrophy, decreased cortical thickness, increased echogenicity (us only), and decreased corticomedullary differentiation (mri only). the consensus findings were analyzed with respect to the patients' sex, age, fabry genotype and phenotype, and renal function. mri was more sensitive than us in detecting radiographic abnormalities. in the 76 classically affected males, the most common us abnormalities were cysts (36.9%; cortical cysts = 22.4%, parapelvic cysts = 14.5%), increased echogenicity (17.1%), and decreased cortical thickness (11.9%), whereas the most common mri abnormalities were cysts (47.3%; cortical cysts = 28.9%, parapelvic cysts = 18.4%), loss of corticomedullary differentiation (43.4%), and decreased cortical thickness (7.9%). among the 40 female carriers, common us abnormalities included cysts (20%; cortical cysts = 10%, parapelvic cysts = 10%) and increased echogenicity (7.5%), whereas mri findings included decreased corticomedullary differentiation (40%) and cysts (37.5%; cortical cysts = 20%; parapelvic cysts = 17.5%). renal us and mri were normal in 5 classically affected males aged 12 years or younger and 2 female carriers aged 20 years or younger. among the 6 male cardiac variants, abnormal us findings included cysts (66.3%; cortical cysts = 50%, parapelvic cysts = 16.3%) and increased echogenicity (33.3%), whereas mri detected decreased corticomedullary differentiation in all (100%) and cysts in 83% (cortical cysts = 66.7%; parapelvic cysts = 16.3%). serum creatinine levels were elevated (>1.2 mg/dl) in 40.8% and 15% of the classically affected males and female carriers with us and/or mri abnormalities compared with 14.8% and 0%, respectively, who had elevated serum creatinine levels but no detectable radiographic abnormalities. there was no association of alpha-gal a genotype with type or frequency of abnormalities in classically affected patients. among classically affected males and female carriers, renal us and/or mri abnormalities were detected in 64.5% and 60%, respectively. the occurrence and number of abnormalities increased with age in affected males and female carriers. cysts, particularly parapelvic cysts, were more common and appeared earlier than in the general population. no renal abnormalities were detected in classically affected males or female carriers <12 years or <20 years of age, respectively. five of the 6 males with the later-onset milder cardiac variant phenotype had loss of corticomedullary differentiation on mri. renal imaging abnormalities were more frequent in older patients with elevated serum creatinine levels, regardless of alpha-gal a genotype or fabry phenotype.	-1
familial hypercholesterolemia mutations in petrozavodsk: no similarity to st. petersburg mutation spectrum.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a human monogenic disease induced by a variety of mutations with striking genetic diversity. despite this variability recurrent mutations occur in each population studied, which allows both elucidating prevalent mutations and developing dna diagnostic tools for the disease. recent research of fh in st. petersburg, moscow and novosibirsk (major cities in russia) demonstrates that each megapolis has its own fh mutation spectrum sharing only small part of mutations with other populations in russia and europe. in order to optimize molecular-genetic diagnostic protocols for fh in russia we studied mutation spectrum in other regions including petrozavodsk, a smaller town in relatively close proximity to st. petersburg. the principal method was automated detection of single-strand conformation polymorphism followed by direct pcr amplified dna sequencing. twelve different mutations of the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor gene were detected in the petrozavodsk sample (80 patients). out of these twelve mutations, seven have never been described before (c.192_201delinsggacttca, c. 195_196inst, c. 618 t > g, c. 1340c > g, c. 1686_1693delinst, c. 1936c > a, c. 2191delg). other five mutations (c. 58g > a, c. 925_931del, c. 1194c > t, c. 1532 t > c, c. 1920c > t) were previously characterized elsewhere. all new mutations are considered to be a probable cause of the fh in their carriers. direct evidence of the neutral character of c.58g > a or p. (gly20arg) is provided for the first time. each pathogenic mutation was a trait of its own unique pedigree and so far has not been found in other patients. strikingly, out of twelve mutations characterized in the petrozavodsk sample only one mutation, c. 925_931del, has previously been found in patients from st. petersburg and finland (most closely located studied populations), suggesting some common roots in origin of these populations in the past or limited gene exchange between them nowadays. no recurrent mutations were detected.	-1
reactive oxygen species generated by pah o-quinones cause change-in-function mutations in p53.  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) in tobacco smoke may cause human lung cancer via metabolic activation to ultimate carcinogens. p53 is one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor genes in this disease. an analysis of the p53 mutational database shows that g to t transversions are a signature mutation of lung cancer. aldo-keto reductases (akrs) activate pah trans-dihydrodiol proximate carcinogens to yield their corresponding reactive and redox-active o-quinones, e.g., benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione (bp-7,8-dione). we employed a yeast reporter system to determine whether pah o-quinones or the ros they generate cause change-in-function mutations in p53. n-methyl-n-nitroso-n'-nitro-guanidine, a standard alkylating mutagen was used as a positive control. mnng caused a dose-dependent increase in mutant yeast colonies and at the highest concentrations 8-14% of the yeast colonies were mutated and were characterized by g:c to a:t transitions in the p53 dna binding domain. treatment of p53 cdna with micromolar concentrations of (+/-)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9alpha,10alpha-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-benzo[a]pyrene, (anti-bpde, an ultimate carcinogen) or sub-micromolar concentrations of bp-7,8-dione in the presence of redox-cycling conditions (nadph and cucl(2)) also caused p53 mutations in a dose-dependent manner. we found that no mutants were observed with pah o-quinones or nadph alone. p53 mutagenesis by bp-7,8-dione was attenuated by ros scavengers and completely abrogated by a combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase, indicating that both superoxide anion and hydroxyl radicals were the responsible mutagens. the bulk of the mutations detected were single-point mutations and were not random in occurrence. over 46% of bp-7,8-dione-induced mutations were g:c to t:a transversions, consistent with the formation of 8-oxo-dguo or its secondary oxidation products. in addition, 25% of these mutations were at hotspots in p53 which are known to be mutated in lung cancer. together these data suggest that pah o-quinones generate an endogenous mutagen (ros) which leads to p53 inactivation. these observations provide an alternative route to g to t transversions that dominate in p53 in lung cancer.	1
"diverse biochemical properties of shp2 mutants. implications for disease phenotypes.  mutations in the src homology 2 (sh2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase shp2 (ptpn11) underlie half of the cases of the autosomal dominant genetic disorder noonan syndrome, and somatic shp2 mutations are found in several hematologic and solid malignancies. earlier studies of small numbers of mutants suggested that disease-associated mutations cause constitutive (sh2 binding-independent) activation and that cancer-associated mutants are more active than those associated with noonan syndrome. we have characterized a larger panel of shp2 mutants and find that this ""activity-centric"" model cannot explain the behaviors of all pathogenic shp2 mutations. instead, enzymatic, structural, and mathematical modeling analyses show that these mutants can affect basal activation, sh2 domain-phosphopeptide affinity, and/or substrate specificity to varying degrees. furthermore, there is no absolute correlation between the mutants' extents of basal activation and the diseases they induce. we propose that activated mutants of shp2 modulate signaling from specific stimuli to a subset of effectors and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the complex relationship between shp2 activation, intracellular signaling, and pathology."	1
new evidence for assessing tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) responsiveness.  to evaluate the protocol we propose for detecting bh(4)-responsive patients and the possibility of delimiting more precisely the population to be tested. we recruited 102 phenylketonuric patients on a phenylalanine (phe)-restricted diet. the initial stage of the protocol was a 24-h bh(4) loading test involving phe loading and subsequent ingestion of the cofactor, a 50% fall in blood phe levels being considered a positive response. the non-responders at this stage then completed a one-week therapeutic test combining bh(4) administration and daily protein intake meeting recommended dietary allowances, to assess whether the 24-h test had detected all responders. the 24-h test detected almost all bh(4) responders (30.3% of the 99 patients included in the analysis), with just two patients (2.0%) subsequently responding positively to the therapeutic test. the 24-h test did not give any false positive results. the 24-h bh(4) loading test is clinically useful for screening phenylketonuric patients. specifically, 95% of patients with phe levels <700 ?mol/l, and none with phe levels >1500 ?mol/l were bh(4)-responsive. given these results, we conclude that patients with phe levels<700 ?mol/l or>1500 ?mol/l probably do not need to be tested, prioritising the identification of bh(4)-responsiveness among individuals with intermediate phe concentrations, between the aforementioned values. additionally, our results suggest that the therapeutic test only needs to be performed in cases where the reduction in blood phe levels after cofactor administration is within the range 40%-50%.	-1
germline intronic and exonic mutations in the wilms' tumour gene (wt1) affecting urogenital development.  denys-drash syndrome is a rare human developmental disorder affecting the urogenital system and leading to renal failure, intersex disorders and wilms' tumour. in this report, four individuals with this syndrome are described carrying germline point mutations in the wilms' tumour suppressor gene, wt1. three of these mutations were in the zinc finger domains of wt1. the fourth occurred within intron 9, preventing splicing at one of the alternatively chosen splice donor sites of exon 9 when assayed in vitro. these results provide genetic evidence for distinct functional roles of the wt1 isoforms in urogenital development.	1
mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype analyses in cowden disease and bannayan-zonana syndrome, two hamartoma syndromes with germline pten mutation.  the tumour suppressor gene pten , which maps to 10q23.3 and encodes a 403 amino acid dual specificity phosphatase (protein tyrosine phosphatase; ptpase), was shown recently to play a broad role in human malignancy. somatic pten deletions and mutations were observed in sporadic breast, brain, prostate and kidney cancer cell lines and in several primary tumours such as endometrial carcinomas, malignant melanoma and thyroid tumours. in addition, pten was identified as the susceptibility gene for two hamartoma syndromes: cowden disease (cd; mim 158350) and bannayan-zonana (bzs) or ruvalcaba-riley-smith syndrome (mim 153480). constitutive dna from 37 cd families and seven bzs families was screened for germline pten mutations. pten mutations were identified in 30 of 37 (81%) cd families, including missense and nonsense point mutations, deletions, insertions, a deletion/insertion and splice site mutations. these mutations were scattered over the entire length of pten , with the exception of the first, fourth and last exons. a 'hot spot' for pten mutation in cd was identified in exon 5 that contains the ptpase core motif, with 13 of 30 (43%) cd mutations identified in this exon. seven of 30 (23%) were within the core motif, the majority (five of seven) of which were missense mutations, possibly pointing to the functional significance of this region. germline pten mutations were identified in four of seven (57%) bzs families studied. interestingly, none of these mutations was observed in the ptpase core motif. it is also worthy of note that a single nonsense point mutation, r233x, was observed in the germline dna from two unrelated cd families and one bzs family. genotype-phenotype studies were not performed on this small group of bzs families. however, genotype-phenotype analysis inthe group of cd families revealed two possible associations worthy of follow-up in independent analyses. the first was an association noted in the group of cd families with breast disease. a correlation was observed between the presence/absence of a pten mutation and the type of breast involvement (unaffected versus benign versus malignant). specifically and more directly, an association was also observed between the presence of a pten mutation and malignant breast disease. secondly, there appeared to be an interdependent association between mutations upstream and within the ptpase core motif, the core motif containing the majority of missense mutations, and the involvement of all major organ systems (central nervous system, thyroid, breast, skin and gastrointestinal tract). however, these observations would need to be confirmed by studying a larger number of cd families.	-1
missense mutation of the beta-cardiac myosin heavy-chain gene in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs as an autosomal dominant familial disorder or as a sporadic disease without familial involvement. we describe a missense mutation of the beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (mhc) gene, a g to t transversion (741 gly-->trp) identified by direct sequencing of exon 20 in four individuals affected with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. three individuals with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, whose parents are clinically and genetically unaffected, had sequence variations of exon 34 of the alpha-cardiac mhc gene (a c to t transversion, 1658 asp-->asp, resulting in foki site polymorphism), of intron 33 of the alpha-cardiac mhc gene (a g to a and an a to t transversion), and also of intron 14 of the beta-cardiac mhc gene (a c to t transversion in a patient with noonan syndrome). including our case, 30 missense mutations of the beta-cardiac mhc gene in 49 families have been reported thus far worldwide. almost all are located in the region of the gene coding for the globular head of the molecule, and only one mutation was found in both caucasian and japanese families. missense mutations of the beta-cardiac mhc gene in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may therefore differ according to race.	-1
cooh-terminal truncated cardiac myosin-binding protein c mutants resulting from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations exhibit altered expression and/or incorporation in fetal rat cardiomyocytes.  mutations in human cardiac myosin-binding protein c (cmybp-c) gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc), and most of them are predicted to produce cooh-truncated proteins. to understand the molecular mechanism(s) by which such mutations cause fhc, we analyzed (i) the accumulation of human cmybp-c mutants in fetal rat cardiomyocytes, and (ii) the protein sequence of the human wild-type (wt) cmybp-c by hydrophobic cluster analysis with the aim of identifying new putative myosin-binding site(s). accumulation and sarcomeric localization of the wt protein and of four fhc-mutant cmybp-cs (e542q and three cooh-truncated proteins) were studied in cardiomyocytes by immunostaining and confocal microscopy after transfection with myc-tagged constructs. we found that: (i) 10 % of the cells expressing cooh-truncated mutants exhibit an incorporation into the a-band of the sarcomere without any alteration of the myofibrillar architecture versus 76 % of those expressing the wt or e542q mutant cmybp-cs (p<0.001); (ii) 90 % of the cells expressing the truncated mutants show a diffuse localization of these proteins in the cardiomyocytes, out of which 45 % exhibit a significant alteration of the sarcomeric structure (p<0.0001 versus wt); and (iii) the two shortest mutant cmybp-cs accumulate at very low levels in fetal rat cardiomyocytes as compared to the wt (p<0.008). protein sequence analysis indicated that a 45-residue sequence in the nh2-terminal c0 domain of cmybp-c exhibits a consistent homology (sequence similarity score of 42 %) with a segment of the nh2-terminal domain of myomesin, another myosin-binding protein. this result suggests that the c0 domain of human cmybp-c contains a novel putative myosin-binding site that could account for the a-band incorporation of the truncated mutants. in addition, the faint accumulation and the diffuse localization of truncated mutants could probably be explained by a low affinity of the c0 domain for myosin. we conclude that cooh-truncated cmybp-cs may act as poison polypeptides that disrupt the myofibrillar architecture and result in the defects observed in fhc.	1
glycogenosis type ii: identification and expression of three novel mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene causing the infantile form of the disease.  glycogenosis type ii (gsdii) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). we identified three novel point mutations, c399a, t1064c, and c2104t, in three unrelated italian patients with the infantile form of the disease. the c399a mutation was present in homozygosity in proband 1. the c >a transition introduces a premature stop signal in exon 2 resulting in no enzyme production that is correlated with the severe clinical phenotype in this patient. the other two nucleotide changes were missense mutations. the t1064c mutation, which changes leu in position 355 into pro, was carried in homozygosity by proband 2. the c2104t nucleotide change, which substitutes arg 702 into cys, was present in proband 3 in combination with a known severe mutation deltai17-18. the in vitro expression in cos-1 cells of t1064c and c2104t constructs demonstrated no enzymatic activity with respect to the negative control cells. western blot analysis revealed that both t1064c and c2104t mutant proteins produced in cos-1 cells migrated in sds-page as the gaa inactive precursor of 110kda. immunofluorescence detection of mutant alpha-glucosidases showed enzyme localization primarily in the er-golgi compartment, suggesting that t1064c and c2104t mutations could affect the normal processing and stability of the enzyme. in vitro studies demonstrated that the same degree of deficiency in t1064c and c2104t mutations, which is in contrast with patient phenotype. a better correlation was observed with the in vivo studies since proband 2, with a less severe phenotype, presented with low residual enzyme activity while in proband 3, with a classic severe infantile onset gsdii, fibroblast enzyme activity was completely absent.	1
targeted genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia using next generation sequencing: a population-based study.  familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) is a common mendelian condition which, untreated, results in premature coronary heart disease. an estimated 88% of fh cases are undiagnosed in the uk. we previously validated a method for fh mutation detection in a lipid clinic population using next generation sequencing (ngs), but this did not address the challenge of identifying index cases in primary care where most undiagnosed patients receive healthcare. here, we evaluate the targeted use of ngs as a potential route to diagnosis of fh in a primary care population subset selected for hypercholesterolaemia. we used microfluidics-based pcr amplification coupled with ngs and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) to detect mutations in ldlr, apob and pcsk9 in three phenotypic groups within the generation scotland: scottish family health study including 193 individuals with high total cholesterol, 232 with moderately high total cholesterol despite cholesterol-lowering therapy, and 192 normocholesterolaemic controls. pathogenic mutations were found in 2.1% of hypercholesterolaemic individuals, in 2.2% of subjects on cholesterol-lowering therapy and in 42% of their available first-degree relatives. in addition, variants of uncertain clinical significance (vucs) were detected in 1.4% of the hypercholesterolaemic and cholesterol-lowering therapy groups. no pathogenic variants or vucs were detected in controls. we demonstrated that population-based genetic testing using these protocols is able to deliver definitive molecular diagnoses of fh in individuals with high cholesterol or on cholesterol-lowering therapy. the lower cost and labour associated with ngs-based testing may increase the attractiveness of a population-based approach to fh detection compared to genetic testing with conventional sequencing. this could provide one route to increasing the present low percentage of fh cases with a genetic diagnosis.	-1
vestibular deterioration precedes hearing deterioration in the p51s coch mutation (dfna9): an analysis in 74 mutation carriers.  to analyze cochleovestibular impairment features in p51s coch mutation carriers (n = 22) in a new, large dutch family and to compare the results to those obtained in previously identified similar mutation carriers (n = 52). to evaluate age-related features between progressive hearing and vestibular impairment of all mutation carriers (n = 74). family study. regression analysis was performed in relation to age to outline the development of hearing thresholds, speech recognition scores, and vestibulo-ocular reflex time constant as the key vestibular response parameter. pure tone thresholds, phoneme recognition scores, and vestibular responses of the mutation carriers in the new family were essentially similar to those previously established in all other mutation carriers. hearing started to deteriorate in all mutation carriers from 43 years of age onwards, whereas deterioration of vestibular function started from age 34. vestibular impairment starts earlier, progresses more rapidly, and, eventually, is more complete than hearing impairment in p51s coch mutation carriers.	-1
molecular epidemiology of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in southern italy: a 96% detection rate with ten novel mutations.  hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) comprises a group of autosomal recessive disorders mainly caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations. we investigated pah mutations in 126 hpa patients from southern italy who were identified in a neonatal screening program. the promoter, coding and exon-flanking intronic sequences of the pah gene were amplified and sequenced. mutations were identified in 240/249 alleles (detection rate: 96.4%). we found 60 gene variants; the most frequent were p.r261q (15.7% of alleles), p.a403v (11.6% of alleles) and c.1066-11g > a (8.8% of alleles). the remaining mutations were rare, and ten are novel. this mutation epidemiology differs from that reported for northern italy and other european countries. we also identified several discordant genotype/phenotype correlations. about two-thirds of all mild phenylketonuria patients showed at least one tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4)-responsive mutation, and are thus candidates for a customized therapeutic approach.	-1
high-density ct of muscle and liver may allow early diagnosis of childhood-onset pompe disease.  pompe disease is classified into infantile-, childhood- and adult-onset forms based on onset age and the degree of organ involvement. differing from the infantile-onset form which is characterized by marked organ involvement, the childhood-onset form usually presents with muscle weakness and elevation of serum creatine kinase (ck), mimicking those of progressive muscular dystrophy. we report our successful early diagnosis and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) in a young girl with childhood-onset pompe disease before the development of skeletal muscle symptoms. she was referred to our hospital at the age of 2 years 4 months because of hyperckemia detected incidentally. she was active and lacked developmental delay and muscle weakness; however, hepatomegaly was noted. the combination of high-density changes in the liver and skeletal muscle on computed tomography (ct) images was suggestive of glycogen storage disorder, especially childhood-onset pompe disease. low alpha-glucosidase (gaa) activity on dried blood spots facilitated the diagnostic process, and genetic analysis of gaa allowed a definitive diagnosis, without performing muscle biopsy. we promptly started ert at the age of 2 years 6 months. after 1 year, she still had not developed any skeletal muscle symptoms, and serum ck level was almost normal. since the efficacy of ert is thought to depend on the extent of muscle damage at its commencement, we expect that ert may have prevented the manifestation of skeletal muscle involvement in this patient.	-1
genetic screening for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  knowledge regarding the genetic basis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer has greatly increased in the past 4 years, namely due to the discovery of segregating germline mutations in the gene coding for e-cadherin, within families with this cancer predisposing syndrome. members of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer families have predominantly high predisposition to develop diffuse carcinomas of the stomach but can also be associated with an elevate risk for other types of cancer, namely lobular breast carcinoma. in this review, we focus on the epidemiology, pathology and genetics of gastric cancer, describe families, e-cadherin mutations, and suggest alternative candidate genes underlying the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome. this knowledge is a fundamental step towards accurate genetic counselling, in which a highly specialized presymptomatic therapeutic intervention should be offered.	-1
molecular basis of phenylketonuria in venezuela: presence of two novel null mutations.  this report describes the mutational spectrum and linked haplotypes of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in venezuela. in this study, we have detected european mutations such as ivs10nt-11, r243q, and r408w on the same haplotype background (6.7, 1.8, and 2.3, respectively) as in europe. in this sample, we have found two novel mutations: s349l detected in two homozygous siblings on the background of haplotype 6.7, and a small deletion, p314fsdelc, that results in a frameshift and a premature stop codon detected on the background of haplotype 4.3. the definite demonstration that mutation s349l results in a nonfunctional protein was shown by expression analysis in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. this mutation results in an unstable phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) protein completely devoid of enzymatic activity well correlated with the severe form of the disease exhibited by the homozygous patients.	-1
cancer-associated pten mutants act in a dominant-negative manner to suppress pten protein function.  pten dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hereditary and sporadic cancers. here, we show that pten homodimerizes and, in this active conformation, exerts lipid phosphatase activity on ptdins(3,4,5)p3. we demonstrate that catalytically inactive cancer-associated pten mutants heterodimerize with wild-type pten and constrain its phosphatase activity in a dominant-negative manner. to study the consequences of homo- and heterodimerization of wild-type and mutant pten in vivo, we generated pten knockin mice harboring two cancer-associated pten mutations (ptenc124s and pteng129e). heterozygous pten(c124s/+) and pten(g129e/+) cells and tissues exhibit increased sensitivity to pi3-k/akt activation compared to wild-type and pten(+/-) counterparts, whereas this difference is no longer apparent between pten(c124s/-) and pten(-/-) cells. notably, pten ki mice are more tumor prone and display features reminiscent of complete pten loss. our findings reveal that pten loss and pten mutations are not synonymous and define a working model for the function and regulation of pten.	1
transmission of the rare hras mutation (c. 173c > t; p.t58i) further illustrates its attenuated phenotype.  costello syndrome was delineated based on its distinctive phenotype including severe failure-to-thrive with macrocephaly, characteristic facial features, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, papillomata, malignant tumors, and cognitive impairment. heterozygous germline mutations in the proto-oncogene hras cause costello syndrome, and its inheritance pattern would thus be autosomal dominant. with exception of two instances of parental mosaicism, one presumed gonadal and the other proven somatic mosaicism for the p.g12s change, all published cases resulted from de novo mutations, typically arising in the paternal germline. more than 90% of these mutations affect the glycine residues in position 12 or 13, and result in a gain-of-function of the altered protein. a rare heterozygous hras alteration (c.173c > t; p.t58i) associated with an attenuated phenotype was previously reported in one patient. we identified two additional individuals with this mutation, father and son. further studies supported origin of the alteration in the grand-paternal germline. transmission of the mutation underscores its attenuated phenotype compatible with reproduction. we reviewed the phenotype in the newly identified individuals (patient 1, 2) and include updated information on the first previously reported individual with hras p.t58i (patient 3). macrocephaly was present in all three. cardiac findings included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with double-chambered right ventricle; or mitral valve prolapse in one patient each. while subtle neurologic abnormalities or developmental delay were present in all, only one showed significant cognitive and functional impairment. none developed papillomata or a malignant tumor. genetic counseling for costello syndrome needs to take into consideration the particular hras mutation.	-1
galactosidase alpha p.a143t variant fabry disease may result in a phenotype with multifocal microvascular cerebral involvement at a young age.  a 16-year-old male presented with episodic headaches and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) that showed multifocal punctate to patchy white matter lesions. the diagnosis of fabry disease (fd) was suggested upon the finding of significantly reduced plasma alpha-galactosidase a activity (0.62 mol/l or 13% of normal; normal range ? 1.65 ?mol/l) and genetic investigation confirmed the presence of a hemizygous missense variant in the galactosidase alpha (gla) gene (p.a143t). baseline assessment of other systemic involvement showed only a discrete proteinuria. fd is a rare lysosomal storage disorder. genetic screening studies have revealed over 600 variants in the gla gene. the p.a143t variant is a genetic variant of unknown significance, with its associated phenotype ranging from classical fd to healthy unaffected patients. some authors, however, deem this variant non-pathogenic. we describe the case of a 16-year-old male with multifocal white matter lesions on brain mri, who was diagnosed with fd and carried this genetic variant. the causative p.a143t mutation can be associated with a more severe subclinical phenotype than has been reported to date. furthermore, a diagnosis of fd should be considered when finding asymptomatic cerebral white matter lesions in a young patient.	1
cross-reactive immunologic material status affects treatment outcomes in pompe disease infants.  deficiency of acid alpha glucosidase (gaa) causes pompe disease, which is usually fatal if onset occurs in infancy. patients synthesize a non-functional form of gaa or are unable to form native enzyme. enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human gaa (rhgaa) prolongs survival in infantile pompe patients but may be less effective in cross-reactive immunologic material (crim)-negative patients. we retrospectively analyzed the influence of crim status on outcome in 21 crim-positive and 11 crim-negative infantile pompe patients receiving rhgaa. patients were from the clinical setting and from clinical trials of rhgaa, were 6 months of age, were not invasively ventilated, and were treated with iv rhgaa at a cumulative or total dose of 20 or 40 mg/kg/2 weeks. outcome measures included survival, invasive ventilator-free survival, cardiac status, gross motor development, development of antibodies to rhgaa, and levels of urinary glc(4). following 52 weeks of treatment, 6/11 (54.5%) crim-negative and 1/21 (4.8%) crim-positive patients were deceased or invasively ventilated (p<0.0001). by age 27.1 months, all crim-negative patients and 4/21 (19.0%) crim-positive patients were deceased or invasively ventilated. cardiac function and gross motor development improved significantly more in the crim-positive group. igg antibodies to rhgaa developed earlier and serotiters were higher and more sustained in the crim-negative group. crim-negative status predicted reduced overall survival and invasive ventilator-free survival and poorer clinical outcomes in infants with pompe disease treated with rhgaa. the effect of crim status on outcome appears to be mediated by antibody responses to the exogenous protein.	-1
a comprehensive functional analysis of pten mutations: implications in tumor- and autism-related syndromes.  the pten (phosphatase and tensin homolog) phosphatase is unique in mammals in terms of its tumor suppressor activity, exerted by dephosphorylation of the lipid second messenger pip(3) (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt/mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin) oncogenic pathway. loss-of-function mutations in the pten gene are frequent in human cancer and in the germline of patients with pten hamartoma tumor-related syndromes (phtss). in addition, pten is mutated in patients with autism spectrum disorders (asds), although no functional information on these mutations is available. here, we report a comprehensive in vivo functional analysis of human pten using a heterologous yeast reconstitution system. ala-scanning mutagenesis at the catalytic loops of pten outlined the critical role of residues within the p-catalytic loop for pip(3) phosphatase activity in vivo. pten mutations that mimic the p-catalytic loop of mammalian pten-like proteins (tpte, tpip, tensins and auxilins) affected pten function variably, whereas tumor- or phts-associated mutations targeting the pten p-loop produced complete loss of function. conversely, ala-substitutions, as well as tumor-related mutations at the wpd- and ti-catalytic loops, displayed partial activity in many cases. interestingly, a tumor-related d92n mutation was partially active, supporting the notion that the pten asp92 residue might not function as the catalytic general acid. the analysis of a panel of asd-associated hereditary pten mutations revealed that most of them did not substantially abrogate pten activity in vivo, whereas most of phts-associated mutations did. our findings reveal distinctive functional patterns among pten mutations found in tumors and in the germline of phts and asd patients, which could be relevant for therapy.	1
mutations in gck and hnf-1alpha explain the majority of cases with clinical diagnosis of mody in spain.  the aim of this study was to group patients with mody (maturity-onset diabetes of the young) according to the genetic alterations underlying the disease and to investigate their clinical characteristics. molecular analysis of gck (mody2), hnf-1alpha (mody3), hnf-4alpha (mody1) and hnf-1beta (mody5) genes was performed by dna sequencing in 95 unrelated index probands (47m/48f; mean age 9.9 +/- 5.2 years) with clinical diagnosis of mody. after classification into mody subtypes according to the genetic alterations, clinical characteristics were compared between the groups. seventy-six families were shown to carry mutations in gck (34 of them previously unreported), eight families presented hnf-1alpha mutations, and a large genomic rearrangement in hnf-1beta was found in a family. no alteration was found in hnf-4alpha. thus, relative frequencies in the group studied were 80% mody2, 8.5% mody3 and 1% mody5. comparison of clinical parameters according to genetic status showed significant differences between mody2 and mody3 patients in age at diagnosis (9.4 +/- 5.4 years vs. 12.7 +/- 4.6 years), diagnosis (impaired glucose tolerance vs. diabetes), diagnostic test used (ogtt vs. fasting glucose), treatment (diet and exercise vs. insulin/oral antidiabetic agents) and birth weight (2.96 +/- 0.44 kg vs. 3.40 +/- 0.67 kg). almost 90% of the mody cases in the group studied are explained by mutations in the major genes gck (mody2) and hnf-1alpha(mody3), although differences in the relative prevalence of each form could be partly due to patient referral bias (paediatric vs. adult). in general, patients with mody2 were diagnosed at an earlier age in life than mody3 patients and had a milder form of diabetes. moreover, the majority of patients with mody2 mutations were treated with diet whereas half of mody3 patients received pharmacological treatment.	-1
time and space clusters of the french-canadian m1v phenylketonuria mutation in france.  we performed mutation analysis and rflp haplotype analysis of chromosomes associated with classical phenylketonuria (pku) in contemporary french families. we also did genealogical reconstructions for seven obligate carriers in five contemporary french-canadian families living in eastern quebec, who carry the m1v mutation causing pku. the m1v mutation, heretofore considered to be associated exclusively with french-canadians, was found on 4 of 152 independent french chromosomes. the french and quebec m1v mutations all occurred on rflp haplotype 2. the contemporary mutant french chromosomes clustered in southern brittany (finistre sud). genealogical reconstructions of the quebec families identified 53 shared ancestors and a center of diffusion in the perche region in 17th century france. the two clusters in france, one historical and the other contemporary, are not incompatible, if one assumes the possibilities that settlers returned from nouvelle france or moved from perche to southern brittany. the m1v mutation is serving as a useful marker for historical demography.	-1
endoplasmic reticulum stress induces autophagy through activation of p38 mapk in fibroblasts from pompe disease patients carrying c.546g>t mutation.  pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type ii) is an autosomal recessive myopathic disorder arising from the deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase (gaa). activation of autophagy is a key pathophysiological feature in skeletal muscle fibers and fibroblasts from patients with pompe disease. the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles has been shown to interfere with the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human gaa. however, the induction mechanism of autophagy in pompe disease is still unclear. in this study, we show that misfolded gaa-induced endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress triggers autophagy in a manner regulated by p38 mapk signaling pathways in fibroblasts from late-onset patients with pompe disease. by studying normal fibroblasts and patient fibroblasts carrying a c.546g>t mutation, we uncovered that mutant gaa was rapidly degraded by proteasome. in addition, we found both activation of er stress response and autophagy in these patient fibroblasts. treatment with n-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (nb-dnj), which acts as a pharmacological chaperone for certain mutant forms of gaa, led to attenuation of not only er stress, but also autophagy in patient fibroblasts. levels of phosphorylated p38 mapk observed in patient fibroblasts were decreased after treatment with nb-dnj. the autophagic response in patient fibroblasts was also negatively regulated by treatment with the p38 mapk inhibitor sb203580. these findings define a critical role for er stress in the activation of autophagy due to gaa mutation, and provide evidence that chaperone therapy may be a useful treatment for alleviation of autophagy in pompe disease patients carrying a chaperon-responsive mutation.	-1
are there low-penetrance tp53 alleles? evidence from childhood adrenocortical tumors.  we have analyzed a panel of 14 cases of childhood adrenocortical tumors unselected for family history and have identified germline tp53 mutations in >80%, making this the highest known incidence of a germline mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene in any cancer. the spectrum of germline tp53 mutations detected is remarkably limited. analysis of tumor tissue for loss of constitutional heterozygosity, with respect to the germline mutant allele and the occurrence of other somatic tp53 mutations, indicates complex sequences of genetic events in a number of tumors. none of the families had cancer histories that conformed to the criteria for li-fraumeni syndrome, but, in some families, we were able to demonstrate that the mutation had been inherited. in these families there were gene carriers unaffected in their 40s and 50s, and there were others with relatively late-onset cancers. these data provide evidence that certain tp53 alleles confer relatively low penetrance for predisposition to the development of cancer, and they imply that deleterious tp53 mutations may be more frequent in the population than has been estimated previously. our findings have considerable implications for the clinical management of children with andrenocortical tumors and their parents, in terms of both genetic testing and the early detection and treatment of tumors.	-1
prediction of functionally significant single nucleotide polymorphisms in pten tumor suppressor gene: an in silico approach.  the phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) gene plays a crucial role in signal transduction by negatively regulating the pi3k signaling pathway. it is the most frequent mutated gene in many human-related cancers. considering its critical role, a functional analysis of missense mutations of pten gene was undertaken in this study. thirty five nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) within the coding region of the pten gene were selected for our in silico investigation, and five nssnps (g129e, c124r, d252g, h61d, and r130g) were found to be deleterious based on combinatorial predictions of different computational tools. moreover, molecular dynamics (md) simulation was performed to investigate the conformational variation between native and all the five mutant pten proteins having predicted deleterious nssnps. the results of md simulation of all mutant models illustrated variation in structural attributes such as root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and total energy; which depicts the structural stability of pten protein. furthermore, mutant pten protein structures also showed a significant variation in the solvent accessible surface area and hydrogen bond frequencies from the native pten structure. in conclusion, results of this study have established the deleterious effect of the all the five predicted nssnps on the pten protein structure. thus, results of the current study can pave a new platform to sort out nssnps that can be undertaken for the confirmation of their phenotype and their correlation with diseased status in case of control studies.	-1
molecular basis of phenylketonuria and related hyperphenylalaninemias: mutations and polymorphisms in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing phenylketonuria or hyperphenylalaninemia have now been identified in many patients from various ethnic groups. these mutations all exhibit a high degree of association with specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism haplotypes at the pah locus. about 50 of these mutations are single-base substitutions, including six nonsense mutations and eight splicing mutations, with the remainder being missense mutations. one splicing mutation results in a 3 amino acid in-frame insertion. two or 3 large deletions, 2 single codon deletions, and 2 single base deletions have been found. twelve of the missense mutations apparently result from the methylation and subsequent deamination of highly mutagenic cpg dinucleotides. recurrent mutation has been observed at several of these sites, producing associations with different haplotypes in different populations. about half of all missense mutations have been examined by in vitro expression analysis, and a significant correlation has been observed between residual pah activity and disease phenotype. since continuing advances in molecular methodologies have dramatically accelerated the rate in which new mutations are being identified and characterized, this register of mutations will be updated periodically.	-1
genetic landscape and novel disease mechanisms from a large lgmd cohort of 4656 patients.  limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (lgmds), one of the most heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders (nmds), involves predominantly proximal-muscle weakness with >30 genes associated with different subtypes. the clinical-genetic overlap among subtypes and with other nmds complicate disease-subtype identification lengthening diagnostic process, increases overall costs hindering treatment/clinical-trial recruitment. currently seven lgmd clinical trials are active but still no gene-therapy-related treatment is available. till-date no nation-wide large-scale lgmd sequencing program was performed. our objectives were to understand lgmd genetic basis, different subtypes' relative prevalence across us and investigate underlying disease mechanisms. a total of 4656 patients with clinically suspected-lgmd across us were recruited to conduct next-generation sequencing (ngs)-based gene-panel testing during june-2015 to june-2017 in clia-cap-certified emory-genetics-laboratory. thirty-five lgmd-subtypes-associated or lgmd-like other nmd-associated genes were investigated. main outcomes were diagnostic yield, gene-variant spectrum, and lgmd subtypes' prevalence in a large us lgmd-suspected population. molecular diagnosis was established in 27% (1259 cases; 95% ci, 26-29%) of the patients with major contributing genes to lgmd phenotypes being: capn3(17%),dysf(16%),fkrp(9%) andano5(7%). we observed an increased prevalence of genetically confirmed late-onset pompe disease,dnajb6-associated lgmd subtype1e andcapn3-associated autosomal-dominant lgmds. interestingly, we identified a high prevalence of patients with pathogenic variants in more than one lgmd gene suggesting possible synergistic heterozygosity/digenic/multigenic contribution to disease presentation/progression that needs consideration as a part of diagnostic modality. overall, this study has improved our understanding of the relative prevalence of different lgmd subtypes, their respective genetic etiology, and the changing paradigm of their inheritance modes and novel mechanisms that will allow for improved timely treatment, management, and enrolment of molecularly diagnosed individuals in clinical trials.	-1
cessation and resuming of alglucosidase alfa in pompe disease: a retrospective analysis.  enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human alglucosidase alfa (rhgaa) in late-onset pompe disease is moderately effective. little is known about the clinical course after treatment termination and the resumption of ert. in switzerland, rhgaa therapy for pompe disease was temporarily withdrawn after the federal court judged that the treatment costs were greatly out of proportion compared to the benefits. re-treatment was initiated after the therapy was finally licensed. we retrospectively analysed seven pompe patients, who underwent cessation and resumption of ert (median age 43 years). the delay from first symptoms to final diagnosis ranged from 4 to 20 years. the demographics, clinical characteristics, assessments with the 6-min walking test (6-mwt), the predicted forced vital capacity (fvc) and muscle strength were analysed. before initiation of ert, all patients suffered from proximal muscle weakness of the lower limbs; one was wheelchair-bound and two patients received night-time non-invasive ventilation. initial treatment stabilised respiratory function in most patients and improved their walking performance. after treatment cessation, upright fvc declined in most and the 6-mwt declined in all patients. two patients needed additional non-invasive ventilatory support. twelve months after resuming ert, the respiratory and walking capacity improved again in most patients. however, aside for one patient, none of the patients reached the same level of respiratory function or distance walked in 6 min, as at the time of ert withdrawal. we conclude that cessation of ert in pompe disease causes a decline in clinical function and should be avoided. resuming treatment only partially recovers respiratory function and walking capacity.	-1
clinical and functional relevance of melanocortin-4 receptor variants in obese german children.  variants in the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) gene are the most frequent cause of monogenic obesity. the relevance of mc4r variations with respect to clinical phenotype and biochemical function remains controversial. we sequenced the mc4r gene in 510 overweight/obese children. the clinical phenotype was assessed in a case-control setting matched for age, gender, puberty and body mass index. identified mc4r variants were functionally characterized in vitro. the frequency of mc4r variants was 5.3%, with functionally relevant mutations (d(90)n, v(103)i/s(127)l, r(165)w, g(181)d) occurring in 1.2% (confidence interval 0.26-2.15) of our sample. 4.1% were carriers of variants (y(35)y, v(103)i, t(112)m, m(200)v, i(251)l) with preserved receptor function in vitro. we did not detect large heterozygous deletions by multiple-ligand probe amplification assay. there were no differences in anthropometric or metabolic parameters between children with loss-of-function mutations and noncarriers. carriers of the v(103)i or i(251)l variant had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hba1c levels than matched noncarriers of mc4r variants. in our data set of childhood obesity in central germany, we identified functionally relevant mutations in the mc4r gene in only 1.2% of the children. there were no major significant phenotypic differences between obese children with and without mc4r mutations. hence, the diagnosis of genetically caused obesity due to mc4r mutation should be made with caution.	-1
extremely discrepant mutation spectrum of slc26a4 between chinese patients with isolated mondini deformity and enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  mutations in slc26a4 cause pendred syndrome (hearing loss with goiter) or dfnb4 (non-syndromic hearing loss with inner ear malformation, such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct or mondini deformity). the relationship between mutations in slc26a4 and mondini deformity without enlarged vestibular aqueduct has not been studied in any chinese deaf population. the purpose of this study was to assess whether mutations in the slc26a4 gene cause mondini deformity without an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (isolated mondini deformity) in a chinese population. in total, 144 patients with sensorineural hearing loss were included and subjected to high-resolution temporal bone ct. among them, 28 patients with isolated mondini dysplasia (md group), 50 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct with mondini dysplasia (eva with md group), 50 patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct without mondini dysplasia (eva group), and 16 patients with other types of inner ear malformations (iem group) were identified. the coding exons of slc26a4 were analyzed in all subjects. dna sequence analysis of slc26a4 was performed in all 144 patients. in the different groups, the detection rate of the slc26a4 mutation differed. in the isolated md group, only one single allelic mutation in slc26a4 was found in one patient (1/28, 3.6%). in the eva with md group, biallelic and monoallelic slc26a4 mutations were identified in 46 patients (46/50, 92.0%) and three patients (3/50, 6.0%), respectively. also, in the eva group, biallelic and monoallelic slc26a4 mutations were identified in 46 patients (46/50, 92.0%) and three patients (3/50, 6.0%), respectively. these percentages were identical to those in the eva plus md group. only two patients carried monoallelic mutations of the slc26a4 gene in the iem group (2/16, 12.5%). there were significant differences in the frequency of slc26a4 mutation among the groups (p<0.001). the detection rate of slc26a4 mutation in the isolated md group was significantly lower than in the eva group (with or without md; p<0.001), and there was no significant difference in the detection rate of slc26a4 between the md group and iem group (p>0.5). although mutations in the slc26a4 gene were frequently found in chinese eva patients with and without md, there was no evidence to show a relationship between isolated md and the slc26a4 gene in the chinese population examined. hearing impairment in patients with isolated md may be caused by factors other than mutations in the slc26a4 gene.	-1
screening mutations of mybpc3 in 114 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by targeted capture and next-generation sequencing.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death. mutations in the mybpc3 gene represent the cause of hcm in ~35% of patients with hcm. however, genetic testing in clinic setting has been limited due to the cost and relatively time-consuming by sanger sequencing. here, we developed a hcm molecular diagnostic kit enabling ultra-low-cost targeted gene resequencing in a large cohort and investigated the mutation spectrum of mybpc3. in a cohort of 114 patients with hcm, a total of 20 different mutations (8 novel and 12 known mutations) of mybpc3 were identified from 25 patients (21.9%). we demonstrated that the power of targeted resequencing in a cohort of hcm patients, and found that mybpc3 is a common hcm-causing gene in chinese patients. phenotype-genotype analyses showed that the patients with double mutations (n = 2) or premature termination codon mutations (n = 12) showed more severe manifestations, compared with patients with missense mutations (n = 11). particularly, we identified a recurrent truncation mutation (p.y842x) in four unrelated cases (4/25, 16%), who showed severe phenotypes, and suggest that the p.y842x is a frequent mutation in chinese hcm patients with severe phenotypes.	-1
germline variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in a healthy, ancestrally diverse cohort: implications for individual genome sequencing.  technological advances coupled with decreasing costs are bringing whole genome and whole exome sequencing closer to routine clinical use. one of the hurdles to clinical implementation is the high number of variants of unknown significance. for cancer-susceptibility genes, the difficulty in interpreting the clinical relevance of the genomic variants is compounded by the fact that most of what is known about these variants comes from the study of highly selected populations, such as cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. the genetic variation in known cancer-susceptibility genes in the general population has not been well characterized to date. to address this gap, we profiled the nonsynonymous genomic variation in 158 genes causally implicated in carcinogenesis using high-quality whole genome sequences from an ancestrally diverse cohort of 681 healthy individuals. we found that all individuals carry multiple variants that may impact cancer susceptibility, with an average of 68 variants per individual. of the 2,688 allelic variants identified within the cohort, most are very rare, with 75% found in only 1 or 2 individuals in our population. allele frequencies vary between ancestral groups, and there are 21 variants for which the minor allele in one population is the major allele in another. detailed analysis of a selected subset of 5 clinically important cancer genes, brca1, brca2, kras, tp53, and pten, highlights differences between germline variants and reported somatic mutations. the dataset can serve a resource of genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in 6 ancestry groups, an important foundation for the interpretation of cancer risk from personal genome sequences.	-1
rapid progressive course of later-onset pompe disease in chinese patients.  pompe disease presents with a wide variety of phenotypes ranging from a fatal disease in infancy (the infantile-onset form) to other milder later-onset forms. currently, the clinical manifestations in chinese patients with later-onset pompe disease are still not well understood. fifteen chinese patients who were clinically diagnosed with pompe disease at later than one year of age at the national taiwan university hospital from 1993 to 2009 were included in this study. confirmatory diagnosis included both biochemical and molecular tests. patient outcomes after recombinant human acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) therapy were also evaluated by assessing the percentage of predicted forced vital capacity in the upright position, hours of daily ventilator use, and the functional status change using walton gardner medwin scale. the median age at symptom onset was 15 (12-35)years, and the median age at diagnosis was 21 (10-38)years. at the time of diagnosis or shortly after, 8 patients (53%) required mechanical ventilation. a quadriceps muscle biopsy from a 13-year-old boy already showed extensive glycogen storage and muscle fiber destruction. mutation analysis revealed that the two dual mutations in the gaa gene c.[1935c>a; 1726g>a] (p.[d645e; g576s]) and c.[2238g>c; 1726g>a] (p.[w746c; g576s]) represented 66.5% of the mutated chromosomes. using mutagenesis, we showed that the p.g576s pseudodeficiency mutation significantly decreased the residual enzyme activity of p.w746c. most patients responded poorly to recombinant human gaa. chinese patients with later-onset pompe disease often showed onset of symptoms in their second decade of life with rapid disease progression, which is probably due to a specific pattern of gaa gene mutation. therefore, early diagnosis and early treatment would be necessary to improve the prognosis of these patients.	1
phenotypical variation within 22 families with pompe disease.  pompe disease has a broad clinical spectrum, in which the phenotype is partially explained by the genotype. the aim of this study was to describe phenotypical variation among siblings with non-classic pompe disease. we hypothesized that siblings and families with the same genotype share more similar phenotypes than the total population of non-classic pompe patients, and that this might reveal genotype-phenotype correlations. we identified all dutch families in which two or three siblings were diagnosed with pompe disease and described genotype, acid ?-glucosidase activity, age at symptom onset, presenting symptoms, specific clinical features, mobility and ventilator dependency. we identified 22 families comprising two or three siblings. all carried the most common mutation c.-32-13 t > g in combination with another pathogenic mutation. the median age at symptom onset was 33 years (range 1-62 years). within sibships symptom onset was either in childhood or in adulthood. the median variation in symptom onset between siblings was nine years (range 0-31 years). presenting symptoms were similar across siblings in 14 out of 22 families. limb girdle weakness was most frequently reported. in some families ptosis or bulbar weakness were present in all siblings. a large variation in disease severity (based on wheelchair/ventilator dependency) was observed in 11 families. this variation did not always result from a difference in duration of the disease since a third of the less affected siblings had a longer course of the disease. enzyme activity could not explain this variation either. in most families male patients were more severely affected. finally, symptom onset varied substantially in twelve families despite the same gaa genotype. in most families with non-classic pompe disease siblings share a similar phenotype regarding symptom onset, presenting symptoms and specific clinical features. however, in some families the course and severity of disease varied substantially. this phenotypical variation was also observed in families with identical gaa genotypes. the commonalities and differences indicate that besides genotype, other factors such as epigenetic and environmental effects influence the clinical presentation and disease course.	-1
a novel germline mutation of pten associated with brain tumours of multiple lineages.  we have identified a novel germline mutation in the pten tumour suppressor gene. the mutation was identified in a patient with a glioma, and turned out to be a heterozygous germline mutation of pten (arg234gln), without loss of heterozygosity in tumour dna. the biological consequences of this germline mutation were investigated by means of transfection studies of the mutant pten molecule compared to wild-type pten. in contrast to the wild-type molecule, the mutant pten protein is not capable of inducing apoptosis, induces increased cell proliferation and leads to high constitutive pkb/akt activation, which cannot be increased anymore by stimulation with insulin. the reported patient, in addition to glioma, had suffered from benign meningioma in the past but did not show any clinical signs of cowden disease or other hereditary diseases typically associated with pten germline mutations. the functional consequences of the mutation in transfection studies are consistent with high proliferative activity. together, these findings suggest that the arg234gln missense mutation in pten has oncogenic properties and predisposes to brain tumours of multiple lineages.	1
novel pharmacological mc4r agonists can efficiently activate mutated mc4r from obese patient with impaired endogenous agonist response.  human melanocortin 4 receptor (hmc4r) mutations with in vitro functional effects are responsible for 0.5-2.5% of severe obesity. designing ligands that are able to counteract this in vitro-associated molecular defect is crucial to develop specific anti-obesity drugs in these genetically associated cases. we analyzed the in vitro effect of two novel melanocortin agonists, irc-022493 and irc-022511, on typical hmc4r mutations chosen based on the nature of their functional alterations, i.e. intracytoplasmic retention and/or reduced basal activity and/or reduced ?-msh potency. we assessed the in vitro ability of irc-022493 and irc-022511 to bind and activate hmc4r mutants. these mutations were found earlier in 11 obese french patients (median age (range) was 17.6 years (5.7-48.0) and body mass index (bmi)-z-score 4.2 s.d. (1.5-5.5). the mc4r agonists were responsible for a significant activation of mutated hmc4r depending on the functional characteristics of the mutations. both agonists were able to activate mutated hmc4r with decreased ?-msh potency, associated with or without decreased basal activity, to the same extent than ?-msh in wild-type mc4r. this result suggests that those mutations would be the best targets for the mc4r agonists among mc4r mutation-bearing obese patients. no specific clinical phenotype was associated with the differential response to pharmacological agonists. we identified two novel melanocortin agonists that were able in vitro to efficiently activate mutated hmc4r with impaired endogenous agonist functional response. these results stimulate interest in the development of these drugs for hmc4r mutations-associated obesity.	1
fabry disease: prevalence of affected males and heterozygotes with pathogenic gla mutations identified by screening renal, cardiac and stroke clinics, 1995-2017.  fabry disease (fd), an x linked lysosomal storage disease due to pathogenic ?-galactosidase a (gla) mutations, results in two major subtypes, the early-onset type 1 'classic' and the type 2 'later-onset' phenotypes. to identify previously unrecognised patients, investigators screened cardiac, renal and stroke clinics by enzyme assays. however, some screening studies did not perform confirmatorygla mutation analyses, and many included recently recognised 'benign/likely-benign' variants, thereby inflating prevalence estimates. online databases were searched for all fd screening studies in high-risk clinics (1995-2017). studies reporting gla mutations were re-analysed for pathogenic mutations, sex and phenotype. phenotype-specific and sex-specific prevalence rates were determined. of 67 studies, 63 that screened 51363patients (33943m and 17420f) and provided gla mutations were reanalysed for disease-causing mutations. of reportedgla mutations, benign variants occurred in 47.9% of males and 74.1% of females. the following were the revised prevalence estimates: among 36820 (23954m and 12866f) haemodialysis screenees, 0.21% males and 0.15% females; among 3074 (2031m and 1043f) renal transplant screenees, 0.25% males and no females; among 5491 (4054m and 1437f) cardiac screenees, 0.94% males and 0.90% females; and among 5978 (3904m and 2074f) stroke screenees, 0.13% males and 0.14% females. among male and female screenees with pathogenic mutations, the type 1 classic phenotype was predominant (~60%), except more male cardiac patients (75%) had type 2 later-onset phenotype. compared with previous findings, reanalysis of 63 studies increased the screenee numbers (~3.4-fold), eliminated 20 benign/likely benign variants, and provided more accurate sex-specific and phenotype-specific prevalence estimates, ranging from ~0.13% of stroke to ~0.9% of cardiac male or female screenees.	-1

muscle ultrasound in classic infantile and adult pompe disease: a useful screening tool in adults but not in infants.  a cohort of 4 infantile and 15 adult pompe patients has been investigated regarding correlation between strength and ultrasound of skeletal musculature. in adults, muscle ultrasound is useful to assess clinical and subclinical involvement of muscles. in this study, visible sonographic changes were found in every clinically affected muscle, using a modified heckmatt scale. in some muscles morphologic changes preceded weakness. regarding the anatomical pattern of involvement, our findings do not support the hypothesis of a specific pattern with a higher vulnerability of vastus intermedius than rectus femoris, which has been postulated before. a frequent sparing of triceps brachii could be confirmed. intramuscular abnormalities occurred in a focal, a diffuse, or an intermediate pattern, with characteristics of both. in contrast to muscular dystrophies, bone echogencity was not markedly decreased in pompe disease even in an advanced stage. in infants, muscle ultrasound showed no distinct pathology even in clinically severely affected children and should not be used as a screening method for infantile pompe disease.	-1
should genetic analysis in newborn screening and a heterozygote test for hyperphenylalaninaemia be recommended? an italian study.  to determine whether the introduction of genetic analysis for phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency into regional screening programmes can be supported by the benefit-cost ratio. tests for the genetic pah locus were carried out in 151 patients with hyperphenylalaninaemia originally from all of the italian regions. pah mutations were identified by extraction of genomic dna from leucocytes (whole blood in edta), pah exon amplification was determined by polymerase chain reaction, restriction enzyme analysis was carried out for some recognised mutations, and dna sequence analysis for the other mutations. it was found that the eight most common mutations in the population accounted for 49% of the mutant alleles, which is well below the required standard for effective population screening (90%). genetic screening for pah deficiency in italy does not increase the sensitivity of the methodology and the benefit-cost ratio, and thus provides no advantage, particularly as the correlation between genotype and the metabolic phenotype needed to optimise dietary intervention is still being studied.	-1
spectrum of mutations in monogenic diabetes genes identified from high-throughput dna sequencing of 6888 individuals.  diagnosis of monogenic as well as atypical forms of diabetes mellitus has important clinical implications for their specific diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted treatment. single gene mutations that affect beta-cell function represent 1-2% of all cases of diabetes. however, phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of family history of diabetes can limit the diagnosis of monogenic forms of diabetes. next-generation sequencing technologies provide an excellent opportunity to screen large numbers of individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes for mutations in disease-associated genes. we utilized a targeted sequencing approach using the illumina hiseq to perform a case-control sequencing study of 22 monogenic diabetes genes in 4016 individuals with type 2 diabetes (including 1346 individuals diagnosed before the age of 40 years) and 2872 controls. we analyzed protein-coding variants identified from the sequence data and compared the frequencies of pathogenic variants (protein-truncating variants and missense variants) between the cases and controls. a total of 40 individuals with diabetes (1.8% of early onset sub-group and 0.6% of adult onset sub-group) were carriers of known pathogenic missense variants in the gck, hnf1a, hnf4a, abcc8, and ins genes. in addition, heterozygous protein truncating mutations were detected in the gck, hnf1a, and hnf1b genes in seven individuals with diabetes. rare missense mutations in the gck gene were significantly over-represented in individuals with diabetes (0.5% carrier frequency) compared to controls (0.035%). one individual with early onset diabetes was homozygous for a rare pathogenic missense variant in the wfs1 gene but did not have the additional phenotypes associated with wolfram syndrome. targeted sequencing of genes linked with monogenic diabetes can identify disease-relevant mutations in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes not suspected of having monogenic forms of the disease. our data suggests that gck-mody frequently masquerades as classical type 2 diabetes. the results confirm that mody is under-diagnosed, particularly in individuals presenting with early onset diabetes and clinically labeled as type 2 diabetes; thus, sequencing of all monogenic diabetes genes should be routinely considered in such individuals. genetic information can provide a specific diagnosis, inform disease prognosis and may help to better stratify treatment plans.	-1

molecular basis of phenylketonuria in cuba.  in this study we report the mutation analysis performed in cuban pku patients using dgge and direct sequencing. sixteen different mutations have been detected, which account for 91% of the total mutant alleles. haplotype analysis and genealogical data support the european (mainly spanish) origin of the mutations. two mutations were found at unexpectedly high frequencies, e280k and r261q, possibly due to consanguinity and genetic drift, among other factors. hum mutat 18:252, 2001.	-1
mutational spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in sicily: implications for diagnosis of hyperphenylalaninemia in southern europe.  hyperphenylalaninemia due to a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. clinically, the disorder is highly heterogeneous, spanning from nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia to classical phenylketonuria. only little is known about the molecular defects underlying hyperphenylalaninemia in southern europe. in this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of 53 patients from the sicilian population. each patient included in the study had persistently elevated blood levels of phenylalanine and met the differential criteria for pah deficiency. genomic dna was analysed by scanning all pah-coding exons for mutations by pcr in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). 52 patients were completely genotyped. a spectrum of 40 different mutations was established including 17 novel pah mutations. our results explain the clinical heterogeneity of hyperphenylalaninemia in southern europe, and form the basis for the establishment of phenotype-genotype correlations in sicily and surrounding countries.	-1
multiplex assessment of protein variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing.  determining the pathogenicity of genetic variants is a critical challenge, and functional assessment is often the only option. experimentally characterizing millions of possible missense variants in thousands of clinically important genes requires generalizable, scalable assays. we describe variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (vamp-seq), which measures the effects of thousands of missense variants of a protein on intracellular abundance simultaneously. we apply vamp-seq to quantify the abundance of 7,801 single-amino-acid variants of pten and tpmt, proteins in which functional variants are clinically actionable. we identify 1,138 pten and 777 tpmt variants that result in low protein abundance, and may be pathogenic or alter drug metabolism, respectively. we observe selection for low-abundance pten variants in cancer, and show that p.pro38ser, which accounts for ~10% of pten missense variants in melanoma, functions via a dominant-negative mechanism. finally, we demonstrate that vamp-seq is applicable to other genes, highlighting its generalizability.	1
recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhgaa) in adult patients with severe respiratory failure due to pompe disease.  pompe disease is a rare metabolic myopathy caused by lysosomal ?-glucosidase deficiency. pompe disease ranges from a rapidly progressive course when symptoms present in infancy to a more slowly progressive rate when symptoms present in childhood or adulthood. this open-label prospective exploratory study investigated the effect of 12 months of recombinant enzyme replacement therapy in 5 adult patients who had already advanced to a very severe stage of pompe disease. muscular and respiratory function, quantitative muscle testing and spirometry were assessed. four patients were tracheostomized. respiratory parameters did not deteriorate. a moderate improvement in sitting/supine slow vital capacity in 2 patients (from 7% to 11% and 28% to 32% of predicted) and reductions of ventilation support in 2 patients was observed. three patients, wheelchair bound at baseline, improved sitting and proximal motor function; 2 patients improved in their ability to stand and transfer. the treatment was well tolerated. alglucosidase alfa may stabilize or even slightly improve muscle strength and respiratory function among patients with severe pompe disease.	-1
improvement in the sensitivity of newborn screening for fabry disease among females through the use of a high-throughput and cost-effective method, dna mass spectrometry.  many female carriers of fabry disease are likely to develop severe morbidity and mortality. however, by our own estimation, around 80% of female newborns are missed by our current enzyme-based screening approach. our team's aim was to develop an improved cost-effective screening method that is able to detect fabry disease among female newborns. in taiwan, based on a database of 916,000 newborns, ~98% of fabry patients carry mutations out of a pool of only 21 pathogenic mutations. an agena iplex platform was designed to detect these 21 pathogenic mutations using only a single-assay panel. a total of 54,791 female infants were screened and 136 female newborns with the ivs4 + 919g > a mutation and one female newborn with the c.656t > c mutation were identified. using the current enzyme-based newborn screening approach as baseline, around 83% of female newborns are being missed. through a family study of the ivs4 female newborns, 30 ivs4 adult family members were found to have left ventricular hypertrophy. ten patients received endomyocardial biopsy and all were found to have significant globotriaosylceramide (gb3) accumulation in their cardiomyocytes. all of these individuals now receive enzyme replacement therapy. we have demonstrated that the agena iplex assay is a powerful tool for detecting females with fabry disease. furthermore, through this screening, we also have been able to identify many disease-onset adult family members who were originally undiagnosed for fabry disease. this screening helps them to receive treatment in time before severe and irreversible cardiac damage has occurred.	-1
molecular basis of hereditary cardiomyopathy: abnormalities in calcium sensitivity, stretch response, stress response and beyond.  cardiomyopathy is caused by functional abnormality of cardiac muscle. the functional abnormality involved in its etiology includes both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, and cardiomyopathy caused by the intrinsic factors is called as idiopathic or primary cardiomyopathy. there are several clinical types of primary cardiomyopathy including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm). linkage studies and candidate gene approaches have explored the disease genes for hereditary primary cardiomyopathy. the most notable finding was that mutations in the same disease gene can be found in different clinical types of cardiomyopathy. functional analyses of disease-related mutations have revealed that characteristic functional alterations are associated with the clinical types, such that increased and decreased ca(2+) sensitivity due to sarcomere mutations are associated with hcm and dcm, respectively. in addition, our recent studies have suggested that mutations in the z-disc components found in hcm and dcm may result in increased and decreased stiffness of sarcomere; that is, stiff sarcomere and loose sarcomere, respectively, and hence altered stretch response. more recently, mutations in the components of i region were found in hereditary cardiomyopathy and the functional analyses of the mutations suggested that the altered stress response was associated with cardiomyopathy, further complicating the etiology and pathogenesis. however, elucidation of genetic etiology and functional alterations caused by the mutations shed lights on the new therapeutic approaches to hereditary cardiomyopathy, such that treatment of dcm with a ca(2+) sensitizer prevented the disease in a mouse model.	-1
low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations in a southeast asian population with familial hypercholesterolemia.  the aim of this study was to detect mutations in the genes coding for the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein b in patients of southeast asian origin with clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) and to relate these findings with the observed lower incidence of coronary heart disease in this part of the world. a total of 86 unrelated patients with fh were selected on clinical grounds, and complete dna analysis of the low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-receptor and apolipoprotein b (apob) genes by dgge and dna-sequencing was performed. in the majority (73%) of the cohort studied, no mutations could be detected, even after extensive analysis of the ldl-receptor and apob genes. however, the 22 patients with a mutation had significantly more xanthomas and a higher incidence of coronary heart disease and levels of low-density lipoproteins were also significantly different. there was no correlation between the type of the mutation and lipoprotein levels or clinical signs of atherosclerosis. the fact that the majority of the fh patients studied had no detectable mutation and that this group had a significant milder phenotype, suggests the presence of a third gene in the southeast asian population, predominantly leading to a disorder resembling a milder form of fh. a similar, but less frequent, trait has recently been described in a number of european families.	-1
tetrahydrobiopterin sensitivity in german patients with mild phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  we report the results of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) loading tests in 10 german patients with mild phenylketonuria. a significant decline of phenylalanine values after application of bh4 was observed in all but one patients. molecular genetic analyses revealed a range of different pah gene mutations. re-testing of one patient previously reported as non-responsive to bh4 loading showed a moderate response with a higher dose of bh4. nevertheless, there appear to be kinetic differences in phenylalanine hydroxylation in patients with the same genotype. non-responsiveness to 20 mg/kg bh4 was observed only in a single patient who was compound heterozygous for the novel mutation r176p (c.527g>c) and the common null-mutation p281l. in summary, our data are in line with recent reports indicating that bh4 sensitivity is a normal feature of most mild forms of pah deficiency but may be influenced by other factors.	-1

angiokeratomas of fabry successfully treated with intense pulsed light.  fabry disease (fd) is a rare x-linked lysosomal storage disorder resulting from the deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase a. angiokeratomas (aks) are a frequent manifestation of this disease. they usually become apparent during childhood and can cause important cosmetic disability. current treatment of this feature in the setting of fd has been mainly based on the application of laser systems, namely the argon laser, the variable pulse width 532-nm nd:yag laser, the 578-nm copper vapor laser and the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser. we report the case of a 31-year-old caucasian woman with a clinical and molecular (gla p.r118c) diagnosis of fd, presenting multiple aks scattered over the buttocks and thighs. she was treated with 10 sessions of intense pulsed light (ipl), with a 4-8-week interval between them. an almost complete clearance of the lesions was obtained, with no scars or significant complaints. no recurrence occurred during a 12-month follow-up period. the ipl source can be considered a suitable, effective and safe treatment modality for these cutaneous lesions that typically affect patients with fd, with no need for local anesthesia and with very satisfactory cosmetic results. to our best knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of fabry's aks treated with ipl.	-1
preliminary screening results of fabry disease in kidney transplantation patients: a single-center study.  fabry disease (fd) is a rare x-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of alfa-galactosidase a (agala) and leads to progressive impairment of renal function in almost all male patients and in a significant proportion of female patients. fd is underdiagnosed or even misdiagnosed in patients undergoing kidney transplantation. we initiated a selective screening study for fd among kidney transplant patients in our center. in this study, 1095 male and female patients were included. dried blood samples on guthrie papers were used to analyze galactosidase a enzyme for male patients. genetic analyses were performed in all female and male patients with low enzyme activity. in total, 648 female and 447 male patients with functioning grafts were evaluated. among 1095 patients, 5 male patients had agala activity below threshold and 3 female patients had galactosidase alpha gene dna variations. one male patient had a disease-causing mutation. the other 4 patients had polymorphisms causing low enzyme activity. all the 3 female patients had mutations that were associated with fd according to human gene mutation database (id: cm025441). in contrast, these mutations were reported as unknown clinical significance in clinvar (rs149391489). the patients with clinical findings suggesting fd were planned to be analyzed for lyso gb3. in our selective screening study, 8 variations were found among 1095 kidney transplantation patients, which needs further investigation to determine causes of fd. clinical findings, physical examination, and family history are also necessary to evaluate the genetic changes as a mutation in this selected population.	-1
polymorphisms in promoter sequences of the p15 ( ink4b ) and pten genes of normal japanese individuals.  gene promoter regions of p15(ink4b), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten), a dual-function protein and lipid phosphatase, interact with regulatory factors for gene transcription and methylation. normal individuals exhibit sequence polymorphisms in these regulatory genes. we isolated genomic dna from whole blood of healthy japanese individuals and sequenced promoter regions of the p15 ( ink4b ) and pten genes. we also examined the influence of polymorphisms on promoter activity in several cell lines. we identified polymorphisms at positions -699, -394, and -242 and an insertion at position -320 in the p15 ( ink4b ) gene and a polymorphism at position -1142 in the pten gene. reporter gene analysis revealed that these polymorphisms influenced transcriptional regulation in their cell lines. our results indicate for the first time that promoter sequences of the p15 ( ink4b ) and pten genes differ among normal japanese individuals and that promoter polymorphisms can influence gene transcription.	1
cardiac structural and sarcomere genes associated with cardiomyopathy exhibit marked intolerance of genetic variation.  the clinical significance of variants in genes associated with inherited cardiomyopathies can be difficult to determine because of uncertainty regarding population genetic variation and a surprising amount of tolerance of the genome even to loss-of-function variants. we hypothesized that genes associated with cardiomyopathy might be particularly resistant to the accumulation of genetic variation. we analyzed the rates of single nucleotide genetic variation in all known genes from the exomes of >5000 individuals from the national heart, lung, and blood institute's exome sequencing project, as well as the rates of structural variation from the database of genomic variants. most variants were rare, with over half unique to 1 individual. cardiomyopathy-associated genes exhibited a rate of nonsense variants, about 96.1% lower than other mendelian disease genes. we tested the ability of in silico algorithms to distinguish between a set of variants in mybpc3, myh7, and tnnt2 with strong evidence for pathogenicity and variants from the exome sequencing project data. algorithms based on conservation at the nucleotide level (genomic evolutionary rate profiling, phastcons) did not perform as well as amino acid-level prediction algorithms (polyphen-2, sift). variants with strong evidence for disease causality were found in the exome sequencing project data at prevalence higher than expected. genes associated with cardiomyopathy carry very low rates of population variation. the existence in population data of variants with strong evidence for pathogenicity suggests that even for mendelian disease genetics, a probabilistic weighting of multiple variants may be preferred over the single gene causality model.	-1
prevalence and clinical implication of double mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: revisiting the gene-dose effect.  available data suggests that double mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are not rare and are associated with a more severe phenotype. most of this data, however, is based on noncontemporary variant classification. clinical data of all hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients with 2 rare genetic variants were retrospectively reviewed and compared with a group of patients with a single disease-causing variant. furthermore, a literature search was performed for all studies with information on prevalence and outcome of patients with double mutations. classification of genetic variants was reanalyzed according to current guidelines. in our cohort (n=1411), 9% of gene-positive patients had 2 rare variants in sarcomeric genes but only in 1 case (0.4%) were both variants classified as pathogenic. patients with 2 rare variants had a trend toward younger age at presentation when compared with patients with a single mutation. all other clinical variables were similar. in data pooled from cohort studies in the literature, 8% of gene-positive patients were published to have double mutations. however, after reanalysis of reported variants, this prevalence diminished to 0.4%. all patients with 2 radical mutations in mybpc3 in the literature had severe disease with death or heart transplant during the first year of life. data on other specific genotype-phenotype correlations were scarce. double mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are much less common than previously estimated. with the exception of double radical mybpc3 mutations, there is little data to guide clinical decision making in cases with double mutations.	-1
glucosylceramide synthase inhibition with lucerastat lowers globotriaosylceramide and lysosome staining in cultured fibroblasts from fabry patients with different mutation types.  fabry disease is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gla gene coding for ?-galactosidase a (?-gala). the deleterious mutations lead to accumulation of ?-gala substrates, including globotriaosylceramide (gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine. progressive glycolipid storage results in cellular dysfunction, leading to organ damage and clinical disease, i.e. neuropathic pain, impaired renal function and cardiomyopathy. many fabry patients are treated by bi-weekly intravenous infusions of replacement enzyme. while the only available oral therapy is an ?-gala chaperone, which is indicated for a limited number of patients with specific 'amenable' mutations. lucerastat is an orally bioavailable inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (gcs) that is in late stage clinical development for fabry disease. here we investigated the ability of lucerastat to lower gb3, globotriaosylsphingosine and lysosomal staining in cultured fibroblasts from 15 different fabry patients. patients' cells included 13 different pathogenic variants, with 13 cell lines harboring gla mutations associated with the classic disease phenotype. lucerastat dose dependently reduced gb3 in all cell lines. for 13 cell lines the gb3 data could be fit to an ic50 curve, giving a median ic50 [interquartile range (iqr)] = 11 ?m (8.2-18); the median percent reduction (iqr) in gb3 was 77% (70-83). lucerastat treatment also dose dependently reduced lysotracker red staining of acidic compartments. lucerastat's effects in the cell lines were compared to those with current treatments-agalsidase alfa and migalastat. consequently, the gcs inhibitor lucerastat provides a viable mechanism to reduce gb3 accumulation and lysosome volume, suitable for all fabry patients regardless of genotype.	1

spectrum of mutations in lebanese patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism resulting from phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. genetic basis of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency has been reported in various european and asian countries with few reports available in arab populations of the mediterranean region. this is the first pilot study describing phenotype and genotype of 23 lebanese patients with phenylketonuria. 48% of the patients presented mainly with neurological signs at a mean age of 2 years 9 months, as newborn screening is not yet a nationwide policy. 56.5% of the patients had classical phenylketonuria. thirteen different mutations were identified: splice site 52%, frameshift 31%, and missense 17% with no nonsense mutations. ivs10-11g>a was found mainly in christians at high relative frequency whereas muslims carried the g352fs and r261q mutations. a rare splice mutation ivs7+1g>t, not described before, was identified in the homozygous state in one family with moderate phenylketonuria phenotype. genotype-phenotype correlation using guldberg arbitrary value method showed high consistency between predicted and observed phenotypes. calculated homozygosity rate was 0.07 indicating the genetic heterogeneity in our patients. our findings underline the admixture of different ethnicities and religions in lebanon that might help tracing back the pah gene flux history across the mediterranean region.	-1
a novel acid alpha-glucosidase mutation identified in a pakistani family with glycogen storage disease type ii.  a novel mutation, c118t, in exon 2 of the acid alpha-glucosidase gene has been found in an infant with glycogen storage disease type ii. this mutation is predicted to result in protein truncation. the phenotype was that of the severe infantile form of the disorder with lack of motor development, but with eye regard, social smile and vocalization. the parents were heterozygous for c118t and belong to an islamic community opposed to termination of pregnancy. as the c118t mutation results in the loss of one of two avai sites present in an informative pcr product, reliable premarriage carrier detection became possible and was acceptable to the members of this extended family.	-1
screening patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy for fabry disease using a filter-paper test: the focus study.  patients with fabry disease (fd) show left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) of sarcomeric origin and might benefit, if detected early, from specific enzyme replacement therapy. the prevalence of fd in patients with lvh of 13 mm or greater, screened using the leucocyte alpha-galactosidase a (?-gal a) activity test, a technique that is difficult to apply routinely, ranged from 0% to 6%. to screen systematically for fd in patients with a diagnosis of hcm (lvh ?15 mm) in primary cardiology practice, a validated, physician-friendly ?-gal a assay was used on dried blood spots using a filter paper test. a cohort of 392 adults (278 men) followed for hcm were screened for fd. a standard blood test was used for confirmation in nine men in whom the ?-gal a result was 40% or less. four men (1.5%; 1.8% of men ?40 years vs 0% <40 years; all with ?-gal a <30%), but no women, were diagnosed with fd. index cases presented with diffuse but asymmetric lvh, with severe obstruction in one case and frequent high-grade atrioventricular conduction block necessitating a pacemaker in three cases. family screening identified eight additional cases. genotyping was performed successfully on dna extracted from the filter papers. in male patients diagnosed as having hcm, pure fd cardiac variants are not exceptional and can be specifically identified using a simple filter-paper test. the sensitivity of this test is low in female patients.	-1

array-based resequencing assay for mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  dissecting the complex genetic basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) may be key to both better understanding and optimally managing this most prevalent genetic cardiovascular disease. an array-based resequencing (abr) assay was developed to facilitate genetic testing in hcm. an affymetrix resequencing array and a single long-range pcr protocol were developed to cover the 3 most commonly affected genes in hcm, myh7 (myosin, heavy chain 7, cardiac muscle, beta), mybpc3 (myosin binding protein c, cardiac), and tnnt2 [troponin t type 2 (cardiac)]. the assay detected the underlying point mutation in 23 of 24 reference samples and provided pointers toward identifying a g insertion and a 3-bp deletion. the comparability of array-based assay results to conventional capillary sequencing was > or =99.9%. both techniques detected 1 heterozygous variant that was missed by the other method. the data provide evidence that abr can substantially reduce the high workload previously associated with a genetic test for hcm. therefore, the hcm array could facilitate large-scale studies aimed at broadening the understanding of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of hcm and related cardiomyopathies.	-1
hras mutation analysis in costello syndrome: genotype and phenotype correlation.  costello syndrome is a rare condition comprising mental retardation, distinctive facial appearance, cardiovascular abnormalities (typically pulmonic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and/or atrial tachycardia), tumor predisposition, and skin and musculoskeletal abnormalities. recently mutations in hras were identified in 12 japanese and italian patients with clinical information available on 7 of the japanese patients. to expand the molecular delineation of costello syndrome, we performed mutation analysis in 34 north american and 6 european (total 40) patients with costello syndrome, and detected missense mutations in hras in 33 (82.5%) patients. all mutations affected either codon 12 or 13 of the protein product, with g12s occurring in 30 (90.9%) patients of the mutation-positive cases. in two patients, we found a mutation resulting in an alanine substitution in position 12 (g12a), and in one patient, we detected a novel mutation (g13c). five different hras mutations have now been reported in costello syndrome, however genotype-phenotype correlation remains incomplete.	-1
molecular basis of fabry disease: mutations and polymorphisms in the human alpha-galactosidase a gene.  fabry disease, an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene at xq22.1. studies of the mutations in unrelated fabry families have identified a variety of lesions indicating the molecular genetic heterogeneity underlying the disease. forty-nine different mutations have been described including five partial gene deletions, one partial gene duplication, nine small deletions and insertions, three splice junction consensus site alterations, and 31 coding region single base substitutions. most mutations resulted in the classical disease phenotype; however, five missense mutations were detected in atypical hemizygotes who were asymptomatic or had symptoms confined to the heart, including n215s, which was described in three unrelated atypical males. most mutations were confined to a single pedigree with the exception of n215s, r227q, r227x, r342q, and r342x, which were each found in several unrelated families. five of the 14 coding region cpg dinucleotides were sites of point mutations including the cpgs in codons 227 and 342, which were each mutated in both orientations. the identification of the mutation in a given fabry family permits precise prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote detection of other family members with this x-linked recessive disease. studies of additional fabry families will provide information on the nature and frequency of the mutations causing this disease as well as potential insights into the structure/function relationships of this lysosomal hydrolase.	-1
mean age-of-onset of familial alzheimer disease caused by presenilin mutations correlates with both increased abeta42 and decreased abeta40.  the varied ways in which mutations in presenilins (psen1 and psen2) affect amyloid b precursor protein (app) processing in causing early-onset familial alzheimer disease (fad) are complex and not yet properly understood. nonetheless, one useful diagnostic marker is an increased ratio of ab42 to ab40 (ab42/ab40) in patients' brain and biological fluids as well as in transgenic mice and cells. we studied ab and app processing for a set of nine clinical psen mutations on a novel and highly reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)-based in vitro method and also sought correlation with brain ab analyzed by image densitometry and mass spectrometry. all mutations significantly increased ab42/ab40 in vitro by significantly decreasing ab40 with accumulation of app c-terminal fragments, a sign of decreased psen activity. a significant increase in absolute levels of ab42 was observed for only half of the mutations tested. we also showed that age-of-onset of psen1-linked fad correlated inversely with ab42/ab40 (r = -0.89; p = 0.001) and absolute levels of ab42 (r = -0.83; p = 0.006), but directly with ab40 levels (r = 0.69; p = 0.035). these changes also partly correlated with brain ab42 and ab40 levels. together, our data suggested that ab40 might be protective by perhaps sequestering the more toxic ab42 and facilitating its clearance. also, the in vitro method we describe here is a valid tool for assaying the pathogenic potential of clinical psen mutations in a molecular diagnostic setting.	1
germline tp53 mutations in brca1 and brca2 mutation-negative french canadian breast cancer families.  about 40% of french canadian breast and/or ovarian cancer families harbor germline brca1 or brca1 mutations where common mutations account for about 84% of all mutations identified in cancer families. within a series of brca1 and brca2 mutation-negative families, a germline tp53 13398 g>a (arg213gln) mutation was identified, which was selected for mutation analysis in this gene because of a family history consistent with li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs). given the founder effects in this population, the 13398 g>a mutation was screened in series of 52 brca1 and brca2 mutation-negative cancer families, and a mutation-positive family was identified. however, pedigree inspection and expansion of mutation-positive families with the same mutation revealed that they were closely related to each other. to further characterize the contribution of tp53 in cancer families, mutation analysis was performed in the remaining brca1 and brca2 mutation-negative cancer families. thirty sequence variants were identified, the majority of which occur in intronic sequences and are not predicted to affect the functionality of tp53. however, the 14538 g>a (arg290his) mutation was identified in a family which did not exhibit features consistent with lfs or li-fraumeni-like (lfl) syndrome. neither of the tp53 mutations was detected in 381 french canadian women with breast cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age not selected for family history of cancer. in all, germline tp53 mutations were identified in two of 52 (3.8%) cancer families, suggesting that tp53 is not a major contributor to brca1 and brca2 mutation-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer families of french canadian descent.	-1
[hereditary gastric cancer].  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome with approximately 70%-80% penetrance. the cumulative lifetime risk of clinically detected gastric cancer is 63%-83% for women and 40%-67% for men. the average age at diagnosis is 40 years. approximately 25%-40% of patients carry a germline mutation of the cdh1 gene. this gene encodes the transmembrane protein e-cadherin which plays a central role in cell adhesion and signal transduction. classified according to laurn, patients develop multifocal diffuse signet-ring cell carcinoma and, in late stages, linitis plastica. in the foveolar neck region, the site of gastric stem cells, in situ signet-ring cell carcinoma has been identified as a precursor lesion of invasive cancer. therein, pagetoid spread of tumour cells below the preserved epithelium within the basal membrane represents the characteristic morphology. pas staining may facilitate detection of tiny lesions.the present article provides detailed information on this cancer syndrome from the point of view of the pathologist as well as the human geneticist, focussing on the multidisciplinary management of affected patients.	-1
mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in azerbaijani population, a report from west azerbaijan province of iran.  phenylketonuria (pku) is a genetic inborn error of phenylalanine (phe) metabolism resulting from insufficiency in the hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah), which leads to elevated levels of phe in the blood. the present study was carried out for mutation analysis of the pah gene in west azerbaijan province of iran. a total of 218 alleles from 40 pku families were studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction (rflp-pcr) method. the frequencies of ivs10-11, s67p, r261q, r252w, ivs11nt-1 g>c, r408q, and q232q mutations were 28(35), 17(21.25), 15(18.75), 3(3.75), 3(3.75), 2(2.5), and 1(1.25), in cases group, and 51(23.4), 31(14.2), 27(12.4), 6(2.75), 6(2.75), 4(1.83), and 2(0.92) in total group, respectively. the mutations of r243q, 364delg, l333f, 261x, i65t, and r408w were not detected in our samples. it can be concluded that the ivs10-11 mutation has the highest frequency in the tested population. to our knowledge, this report is the first in its own kind and provides better understanding of the genetic heterogeneity, the origin and distributions of pah mutations in west azerbaijan province of iran.	-1
molecular epidemiology of usher syndrome in italy.  usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing and vision loss. usher syndrome is divided into three clinical subclasses (type 1, type 2, and type 3), which differ in terms of the severity and progression of hearing loss and the presence or absence of vestibular symptoms. usher syndrome is defined by significant genetic heterogeneity, with at least 12 distinct loci described and 9 genes identified. this study aims to provide a molecular epidemiology report of usher syndrome in italy. molecular data have been obtained on 75 unrelated italian patients using the most up-to date technology available for the screening of usher syndrome gene mutations, i.e., the genotyping microarray developed by asper biotech (tartu, estonia), which simultaneously investigates 612 different marker positions using the well established arrayed primer extension methodology (apex). using this method, we found that 12% of cases (9 out of 75) harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the gene positions analyzed, whereas 20% (15 out of 75) of the patients were characterized by the presence of only one mutated allele based on the positions analyzed. one patient was found to be compound heterozygous for mutations in two different genes and this represents an example of possible digenic inheritance in usher syndrome. a total of 66.6% of cases (50 out of 75) were found to be completely negative for the presence of usher syndrome gene mutations in the detected positions. mutations detected by the array were confirmed by direct sequencing. these findings highlight the efficacy of the apex-based genotyping approach in the molecular assessment of usher patients, suggesting the presence of alleles not yet identified and/or the involvement of additional putative genes that may account for the pathogenesis of usher syndrome.	-1
two novel pah gene mutations detected in italian phenylketonuric patients.  we report the identification by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis of two new phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations (ivs4nt-2 and n207s) in single chromosomes of two unrelated italian phenylketonuric (pku) patients. interestingly, mutation y204c, found on the second mutant allele of family f1, has been previously detected in chinese patients. haplotype analysis showed that the latter mutation is linked to the same haplotype (h4) in both chinese and italian patients, suggesting a common origin. in vivo assessment of mutation severity indicates that n207s is associated with classic pku. the identification of these two new mutations further extends the remarkable heterogeneity of the pah locus in the italian population.	-1
prenatal diagnosis of chinese families with phenylketonuria.  the aim of this study is to investigate the ability to prenatally diagnose phenylketonuria (pku) by using phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutation analysis combined with short tandem repeat (str) linkage analysis in 118 fetuses from 112 chinese families. genomic dna was extracted from the peripheral blood from members of 112 families and the exons and exon-intron boundaries of the pah gene were amplified by pcr. pcr products were analyzed by bi-directional sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa). the three variable number of tandem repeat (vntr) markers pah-1, pah-26, pah-32 were used in the prenatal diagnosis for the pku families. we identified a spectrum of 63 different mutations, including 61 point mutations and indels, two large exon deletion mutations, and five novel mutations. a substantial proportion of mutant alleles were accounted for by p.r243q (15.62%), ex6-96ag (9.82%), p.v399v (7.59%), p.y356x (6.70%), and p.r413p (5.36%). the same mutations were identified in 31 prenatally genotyped fetuses. we identified 58 fetuses that carried only one mutant allele and 29 fetuses that carried no mutations of pah and were presumed normal. pah gene mutation analysis combined with str linkage analysis can provide rapid and accurate prenatal diagnosis for pku families.	-1
"frequent mutations in japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency.  we screened 22 japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency (seven with the infantile type, eight with the juvenile type and seven with the adult type) for three previously described mutations, d645e, s529v and r672q, and a novel mutation, r600c. although d645e has been reported to be common in chinese patients with the infantile type, only three of 44 alleles (two of 14 infantile type alleles) from japanese patients harbored the d645e mutation. the s529v mutation was identified in six of 14 alleles from adult-onset patients. none of the infantile or juvenile patients harbored the s529v mutation. therefore, s529v apparently results in the adult type disease and is common in japanese adult-onset patients. r672q was identified in two pairs of siblings with the juvenile type. a novel mutation, r600c, was identified in eight of 22 patients (nine of 44 alleles). therefore, r600c is another common japanese mutation occurring at a cpg dinucleotide ""hot spot"". homozygosity for this mutation apparently results in the infantile phenotype. genetic diagnosis by detecting these four mutations might be feasible for most japanese patients with acid maltase deficiency."	-1
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: association with lobular breast cancer.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) has been shown to be caused by germline mutations in the gene cdh1 located at 16q22.1, which encodes the cell-cell adhesion molecule, e-cadherin. not only does loss of expression of e-cadherin account for the morphologic differences between intestinal and diffuse gastric cancer (dgc) variants, but it also appears to lead to distinct cellular features which appear to be common amongst related cancers that have been seen in the syndrome. as in most hereditary cancer syndromes, multiple organ sites may be commonly affected by cancer, in hdgc, lobular carcinoma of the breast (lbc) and possibly other organ sites have been shown to be associated with the familial cancer syndrome. given the complexity of hdgc, not only with regard to the management of the dgc risk, but also with regard to the risk for other related cancers, such as lbc, a multi-disciplinary approach is needed for the management of individuals with known cdh1 mutations.	-1
comparison of dysferlin expression in human skeletal muscle with that in monocytes for the diagnosis of dysferlin myopathy.  dysferlinopathies are caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene (dysf). diagnosis is complex due to the high clinical variability of the disease and because dysferlin expression in the muscle biopsy may be secondarily reduced due to a primary defect in some other gene. dysferlin is also expressed in peripheral blood monocytes (pbm). studying dysferlin in monocytes is used for the diagnosis of dysferlin myopathies. the aim of the study was to determine whether dysferlin expression in pbm correlates with that in skeletal muscle. using western-blot (wb) we quantified dysferlin expression in pbm from 21 pathological controls with other myopathies in whom mutations in dysf were excluded and from 17 patients who had dysferlinopathy and two mutations in dysf. results were compared with protein expression in muscle by wb and immunohistochemistry (ih). we found a good correlation between skeletal muscle and monocytes using wb. however, ih results were misleading because abnormal expression of dysferlin was also observed in 13/21 pathological controls. the analysis of dysferlin protein expression in pbm is helpful when: 1) the skeletal muscle ih pattern is abnormal or 2) when muscle wb can not be performed either because muscle sample is lacking or insufficient or because the muscle biopsy is taken from a muscle at an end-stage and it mainly consists of fat and fibrotic tissue.	-1
targeted screening for the detection of pompe disease in patients with unclassified limb-girdle muscular dystrophy or asymptomatic hyperckemia using dried blood: a spanish cohort.  we aimed to screen for pompe disease in patients with unclassified limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (lgmd) or asymptomatic hyperckemia using dried blood spot (dbs) assays. subsequently, we aimed to calculate the diagnostic delay between initial symptom presentation and the diagnosis. a prospective, multicenter, observational study was conducted in 348 patients: 146 with unclassified lgmd and 202 with asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic hyperckemia. we quantified levels of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) from dried blood spots analyzed fluorometrically. the test was positive in 20 patients, and pompe disease was confirmed by genetic testing in 16. undiagnosed pompe disease was detected in 7.5% of patients with lgmd and in 2.5% of patients with persistent, idiopathic elevation of serum creatine kinase. the c.-32-13 t > g mutation was found most commonly. the diagnostic delay was 15 years on average. in conclusion, dbs tests are useful and reliable screening tools for pompe disease. we recommend the dried blood spot test to be included in the diagnostic work-up of patients with unclassified myopathies with proximal weakness and/or hyperckemia of unknown cause and, when positive, to define the diagnosis, it will have to be confirmed by biochemical and/or molecular genetic analysis.	-1
"genetic defects causing familial hypercholesterolaemia: identification of deletions and duplications in the ldl-receptor gene and summary of all mutations found in patients attending the hammersmith hospital lipid clinic.  familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) results from defective catabolism of low density lipoproteins (ldl), leading to premature atherosclerosis and early coronary heart disease. it is commonly caused by mutations in ldlr, encoding the ldl receptor that mediates hepatic uptake of ldl, or in apob, encoding its major ligand. more rarely, dominant mutations in pcsk9 or recessive mutations in ldlrap1 (arh) cause fh, gene defects that also affect the ldl-receptor pathway. we have used multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) to identify deletions and rearrangements in ldlr, some not detectable by southern blotting, thus completing our screening for mutations causing fh in a group of fh patients referred to a lipid clinic in london. to summarise, mutations in ldlr were found in 153 unrelated heterozygous fh patients and 24 homozygotes/compound heterozygotes, and in over 200 relatives of 80 index patients. ldlr mutations included 85 different point mutations (7 not previously described) and 13 different large rearrangements. the apob r3500q mutation was present in 14 heterozygous patients and a mutation in pcsk9 in another 4; ldlrap1 mutations were found in 4 ""homozygous"" fh patients. our data confirm that dna-based diagnosis provides information that is important for management of fh in a considerable number of families."	-1
validation of ldlr activity as a tool to improve genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia: a retrospective on functional characterization of ldlr variants.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by high blood-cholesterol levels mostly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr). with a prevalence as high as 1/200 in some populations, genetic screening for pathogenic ldlr mutations is a cost-effective approach in families classified as 'definite' or 'probable' fh and can help to early diagnosis. however, with over 2000 ldlr variants identified, distinguishing pathogenic mutations from benign mutations is a long-standing challenge in the field. in 1998, the world health organization (who) highlighted the importance of improving the diagnosis and prognosis of fh patients thus, identifying ldlr pathogenic variants is a longstanding challenge to provide an accurate genetic diagnosis and personalized treatments. in recent years, accessible methodologies have been developed to assess ldlr activity in vitro, providing experimental reproducibility between laboratories all over the world that ensures rigorous analysis of all functional studies. in this review we present a broad spectrum of functionally characterized missense ldlr variants identified in patients with fh, which is mandatory for a definite diagnosis of fh.	1
clinical and molecular genetic study of infantile-onset pompe disease in chinese patients: identification of 6 novel mutations.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and is caused by a deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). a broad range of studies have been performed on pompe patients from different countries. however, the clinical course and molecular basis of the disease in mainland china have not been well defined. in the present study, we examined a total of 18 chinese children with infantile-onset pompe disease to better understand the clinical and genetic features in this population. the median age at symptom onset was 3.6 months (range: 1.7-6.8 months) and 6.3 months at diagnosis (range: 2.5-9.3 months). all but 1 patient died at a median age of 8.2 months (range: 4.7-18.7 months). molecular analysis revealed 20 different mutations, 6 of which are novel (c.1356delc, c.378g>a, c.1827c>g, c.859-2 a>t, c.1551+2t>g, and c.1465g>t). the most common mutation in the study was c.1935c>a, accounting for 25% (9/36 alleles) of the mutations. our study provides the first comprehensive examination of the clinical course of infantile-onset pompe disease and mutations of the gaa gene for patients in mainland china. our results confirm the high prevalence of the c.1935c>a mutation, previously reported for other populations, in mainland chinese patients with infantile-onset pompe disease. furthermore, six novel mutations in the gaa gene are reported for the first time.	-1
very early treatment for infantile-onset pompe disease contributes to better outcomes.  to evaluate whether very early treatment in our patients would result in better clinical outcomes and to compare these data with other infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd) cohort studies. in this nationwide program, 669,797 newborns were screened for pompe disease. we diagnosed iopd in 14 of these newborns, and all were treated and followed in our hospital. after 2010, the mean age at first enzyme-replacement therapy (ert) was 11.92 days. our patients had better biological, physical, and developmental outcomes and lower anti-rh acid ?-glucosidase antibodies after 2 years of treatment, even compared with one group that began ert just 10 days later than our cohort. no patient had a hearing disorder or abnormal vision. the mean age for independent walking was 11.6  1.3 months, the same age as normal children. ert for patients with iopd should be initiated as early as possible before irreversible damage occurs. our results indicate that early identification of patients with iopd allows for the very early initiation of ert. starting ert even a few days earlier may lead to better patient outcomes.	-1
[early diagnosis of fabry disease in children].  fabry disease, a rare x-linked lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by deficiency of the enzyme ?-galactosidase a. the incidence, ranging from one over 40 000 to one over 11 7000 worldwide is probably underestimated due to its unspecific pattern of presentation. the symptoms, including neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, ophthalmological and dermatologic manifestations, start in childhood and adolescence, cause a significant morbidity and are likely to affect the patient's quality of life. furthermore, anderson-fabry disease always progress leading to a multiorgan dysfunction and life-threatening complications with end-stage renal disease, cardiomyopathy and high incidence of stroke. the estimated life in untreated patients is reduced by 15-20 years respectively in men and women. the enzyme replacement therapy, available in europe from 2001, results in a reduction of major organs failure, morbidity and mortality. we present the case of an 8-year-old male admitted to our division for overweight with a previous history of acroparesthesias, severe acute pain in hands and feet, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bitemporal headache, dyshidrosis, recurrent fever, exercise intolerance and reduced quality of life. the physical examination was within normal limits. the ?-galactosidase a activity was deficient in plasma and normal in peripheral leukocytes; the gla gene showed a nucleotide substitution c.352c>t (p.arg 118 cys) in the eson 2 with a residual enzyme activity of the 29% suggesting the diagnosis of fabry disease. blood and urine chemistry, the slit-lamp examination and mri of kidneys, heart and brain excluded any major organ involvement. the enzyme replacement therapy was then started almost three months ago using agasidase alfa at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg infused intravenously every two weeks but, unfortunately, no relief in the symptoms have been reported so far without any severe adverse reactions. this case report aims to point out the importance of an early diagnosis in order to prevent the progression of the disease, the multiorgan failure and to improve the long-term prognosis.	-1
ptpn11 gene analysis in 74 brazilian patients with noonan syndrome or noonan-like phenotype.  mutations in the ptpn11 gene are known to cause a large fraction of the cases of noonan syndrome. the objective of this study was to determine the ptpn11 gene mutation rate in a cohort of clinically well-characterized brazilian patients with noonan or noonan-like syndromes and to study the genotype-phenotype correlation. fifty probands with noonan syndrome ascertained according to well-established diagnostic criteria, 3 with leopard syndrome, 5 with noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, and 3 with neurofibromatosis/ noonan were enrolled in this study. mutational analysis was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) followed by sequencing of amplicons with an aberrant elution profile. we detected missense mutations in the ptpn11 gene in 21 probands with noonan syndrome (42%), in all 3 patients with leopard syndrome, and in 1 case with noonan-like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome. one patient with neurofibromatosis-noonan syndrome had a mutation in both the ptpn11 and nf1 genes. the only anomalies that reached statistical significance when comparing probands with and without mutations were the hematological abnormalities. our data confirms that noonan syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, with mutations in the ptpn11 gene responsible for roughly 50% of the cases. a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established, but the t73i mutation seems to predispose to a myeloproliferative disorder. regarding noonan-like syndromes, mutation of the ptpn11 gene is the main causal factor in leopard syndrome, and it also plays a role in neurofibromatosis-noonan syndrome. noonan- like/multiple giant cell lesion syndrome, part of the spectrum of noonan syndrome, is also heterogeneous.	-1
tumour p53 mutations exhibit promoter selective dominance over wild type p53.  the tumour suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer. tumour derived p53 mutants are usually transcriptionally inactive, but some mutants retain the ability to transactivate a subset of p53 target genes. in addition to simple loss of function, some p53 mutants may be carcinogenic through a dominant negative mechanism. aiming at a more general classification of p53 mutants into predictive functional categories it is important to determine (i) which p53 mutants are dominant, (ii) what features characterize dominant mutants and (iii) whether dominance is target gene specific. the ability of 71 p53 mutants to inhibit wild type p53 was determined using a simple yeast transcriptional assay. approximately 30% of the mutants were dominant. they preferentially affect highly conserved amino acids (p<0.005), which are frequently mutated in tumours (p<0.005), and usually located near the dna binding surface of the protein (p<0.001). different tumour-derived amino acid substitutions at the same codon usually have the same dominance phenotype. to determine whether the ability of p53 mutants to inhibit wild type p53 is target gene specific, the dominance towards p21, bax, and pig3 binding sites was examined. approximately 40% of the 45 mutants examined were dominant for the p21 (17/45) or pig3 (20/45) responsive elements and 71% (32/45) were dominant for the bax responsive element. these differences are statistically significant (p21 vs bax, p<0.003; bax vs pig3, p<0.02, fisher's exact test) and defined a hierarchy of dominance. finally, we extended the analysis to a group of mutants isolated in brca-associated tumours, some of which retained wild type level of transcription in yeast as well as in human cells, but show gain of function in transformation assays. since transformation assays require transdominant inhibition of the endogenous wild type allele, one possible explanation for the behaviour of the brca-associated mutants is that they adopt conformations able to bind dna alone but not in mixed tetramers with wild type p53. the yeast data do not support this explanation, because all brca-associated mutants that behaved as wild type in transcription assay were recessive in dominance assays.	1
identification of slc26a4 mutations in patients with hearing loss and enlarged vestibular aqueduct using high-resolution melting curve analysis.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene can cause both pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, two conditions associated with sensorineural hearing loss. we analyzed the slc26a4 gene in 44 hearing-impaired patients by nested polymerase chain reaction followed by high-resolution melt analysis. we also used this approach to scan for mutations in kcnj10 and foxi1, two genes reported to play a role in the pathogenesis of pendred syndrome and enlarged vestibular aqueduct. seven patients with known slc26a4 mutations were included as controls. all previously identified mutations were detected by high-resolution melt analysis. of the patients with no known mutations, we detected two slc26a4 mutations in 5 probands (12%), one mutation in 9 probands (21%), and no mutations in 29 probands (67%). we identified two novel slc26a4 mutations, p.t485m and p.f718s, and found no evidence of a digenic contribution of kcnj10 and foxi1 mutations.	-1
slc26a4 p.thr410met homozygous mutation in a patient with a cystic cochlea and an enlarged vestibular aqueduct showing characteristic features of incomplete partition type i and ii.  mutations of slc26a4 are associated with incomplete partition type ii (ip-ii) and isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (eva). we experienced a congenitally deaf 6-year-old boy with a rare p.thr410met homozygous mutation in slc26a4 who underwent bilateral cochlear implantation. he had bilateral inner ear malformation, in which the dilated vestibule and eva were identical to those in ip-ii, but the cochlea lacking a bony modiolus resembled that in incomplete partition type i. these results suggest that homozygous mutations in slc26a4 are always associated with eva, while the severity of cochlear malformation may vary depending on the type of slc26a4 mutation.	-1
phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia in eastern germany: a characteristic molecular profile and 15 novel mutations.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an important error of amino acid metabolism which results in most patients from phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency. pku displays a marked genotypic heterogeneity both within and between different populations. the aim of this study was to establish the genotypic spectrum of pku in eastern germany, and to compare this to the distribution of mutations in western germany. the study population included 302 patients in 290 families who were followed at treatment centers in berlin, leipzig and jena. the study showed marked genotypic variability with a total of 75 mutations, including 15 that have so far not been described (eleven missense mutations, one splicing mutation, and three small deletions). one of these novel mutations, e183q, occurred in cis to a r408w mutation. in the non-immigrant eastern german population, the frequency of r408w accounted for 40.1% of the pku alleles. in the immigrant turkish population of the former west berlin, the most prevalent mutation was ivs10-11g>a (57%). there was a marked difference of the genotypic spectrum between the population studied here and the data reported from the western part of the country.	-1
prevalence and functional consequence of tp53 mutations in pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma: a children's oncology group study.  adrenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a rare pediatric malignancy. it occurs in excess among individuals with the li-fraumeni syndrome, which results primarily from germline mutations in the tp53 gene. prior series exploring frequencies of germline tp53 mutation among children with acc have been small, geographically limited, or subject to referral bias. the functional consequence of mutations has not been related to phenotype. we provide a genotype-phenotype analysis of tp53 mutations in pediatric acc and propose a model for tissue-specific effects based on adrenocortical ontogeny. eighty-eight consecutive, unrelated children with acc, unselected for family history, underwent germline tp53 sequencing. rate and distribution of mutations were identified. functional analysis was performed for novel tp53 variants. correlation with the international agency for research on cancer p53 database further delineated mutational distribution, association with family history, and risk for multiple primary malignancies (mpms). germline mutations were present in 50% of children. these mutations did not correspond to the conventional hotspot mutations. there was a wide range of mutant protein function. patients bearing alleles encoding protein with higher functionality were less likely to have a strong family cancer history, whereas those with greater loss of function had mpms and/or positive family history. in patients with mpms, acc was the most frequent initial malignancy. finally, we demonstrated age-dependent rates of tp53 mutation positivity. tp53 mutations are prevalent in children with acc but decline with age. mutations result in a broad spectrum of functional loss. effect of individual mutations may predict carrier and familial disease penetrance with potentially broad implications for clinical surveillance and counseling.	1
pharmacological chaperones restore function to mc4r mutants responsible for severe early-onset obesity.  heterozygous null mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) cause early-onset obesity in humans, indicating that metabolic homeostasis is sensitive to quantitative variation in mc4r function. most of the obesity-causing mc4r mutations functionally characterized so far lead to intracellular retention of receptors by the cell's quality control system. thus, recovering cell surface expression of mutant mc4rs could have a beneficial therapeutic value. we tested a pharmacological chaperone approach to restore cell surface expression and function of 10 different mutant forms of human melanocortin-4 receptor found in obese patients. five cell-permeant mc4r-selective ligands were tested and displayed pharmacological chaperone activities, restoring cell surface targeting and function of the receptors with distinct efficacy profiles for the different mutations. such mutation-specific efficacies suggested a structure-activity relationship between compounds and mutant receptor conformations that may open a path toward personalized therapy. in addition, one of the five pharmacological chaperones restored function to most of the mutant receptors tested. combined with its ability to reach the central nervous system and its selectivity for the mc4r, this pharmacological chaperone may represent a candidate for the development of a targeted therapy suitable for a large subset of patients with mc4r-deficient obesity.	1
association between cowden syndrome and lhermitte-duclos disease: report of two cases and review of the literature.  the authors describe 2 cases of dysplasic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum or lhermitte-duclos disease revealing cowden disease or multiple hamartoma neoplasia syndrome. cowden disease is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, now considered as a phakomatosis. nevertheless, relationships between both conditions still remain unclear, since lhermitte-duclos disease can also be sporadic. two patients, 25 and 27 years old, were admitted to the emergency department for an acute intracranial hypertension. in both cases, magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan showed a mass in the cerebellar hemisphere. pathological examination of surgical resection specimens concluded lhermitte-duclos disease. because of the patients' previous personal and familial medical history, cowden disease was suspected and confirmed by mutational analysis of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) gene. in the first case, a nonsense punctual mutation in exon 8 was found. in the second one, a mutation was revealed in the exon 5, a mutational hot spot encoding the phosphatase catalytic core motif. lhermitte-duclos disease and cowden disease can be associated. germline mutations of pten gene are known to be implicated in cowden disease. this gene, located at chromosome 10q23-3, is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a protein with phosphatase activity. to date, more than 80 mutations have been reported in cowden disease. when the diagnosis of either one of these two disorders is established, it is imperative to search for the other one to detect early malignant lesions that occur in cowden disease. finally, a long-term follow up of the patient is required and a thorough familial screening is necessary.	-1
reassessment of mendelian gene pathogenicity using 7,855 cardiomyopathy cases and 60,706 reference samples.  the accurate interpretation of variation in mendelian disease genes has lagged behind data generation as sequencing has become increasingly accessible. ongoing large sequencing efforts present huge interpretive challenges, but they also provide an invaluable opportunity to characterize the spectrum and importance of rare variation. we analyzed sequence data from 7,855 clinical cardiomyopathy cases and 60,706 exome aggregation consortium (exac) reference samples to obtain a better understanding of genetic variation in a representative autosomal dominant disorder. we found that in some genes previously reported as important causes of a given cardiomyopathy, rare variation is not clinically informative because there is an unacceptably high likelihood of false-positive interpretation. by contrast, in other genes, we find that diagnostic laboratories may be overly conservative when assessing variant pathogenicity. we outline improved analytical approaches that evaluate which genes and variant classes are interpretable and propose that these will increase the clinical utility of testing across a range of mendelian diseases.genet med 19 2, 192-203.	-1
"compound and double mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: implications for genetic testing and counselling.  to report the frequency of single and multiple gene mutations in an australian cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm). genetic screening of seven hcm genes (beta-mhc, mybp-c, ctnt, ctni, actc, myl2, and myl3) was undertaken in 80 unrelated probands. screening was by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct dna sequencing. clinical data were collected on all patients and on genotyped family members. 26 mutations were identified in 23 families (29%). nineteen probands (24%) had single mutations (11 beta-mhc, 4 mybp-c, 3 ctni, 1 ctnt). multiple gene mutations were identified in four probands (5%): one had a double mutation and the others had compound mutations. six of 14 affected individuals from multiple mutation families (43%) experienced a sudden cardiac death event, compared with 10 of 55 affected members (18%) from single mutation families (p = 0.05). there was an increase in septal wall thickness in patients with compound mutations (mean (sd): 30.7 (3.1) v 24.4 (7.4) mm; p<0.05). multiple gene mutations occurring in hcm families may result in a more severe clinical phenotype because of a ""double dose"" effect. this highlights the importance of screening the entire panel of hcm genes even after a single mutation has been identified."	-1
p.d645e of acid ?-glucosidase is the most common mutation in thai patients with infantile-onset pompe disease.  to describe genetic features of five unrelated thai families with infantile-onset pompe disease caused by mutations in the acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) gene. total rna and genomic dna were extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and mutation analysis of the entire coding regions of the gaa gene was performed in our first patient. polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was also used for a particular mutation in subsequent patients. the mutation analysis revealed that all patients harbored the same mutation, c.1935c > a (p.d645e), with three being homozygotes. the p.d645e, therefore, accounted for 80% (8 out of 10 alleles) of the mutations. we identified five unrelated thai patients with infantile-onset pompe disease with no history of consanguinity. finding of the most common mutation, p.d645e, in this study will help facilitate prenatal diagnosis of their family members and molecular diagnosis of future suspected patients. analysis of common mutations could be the most effective strategy in identifying gaa mutations responsible for pompe disease in the thai population.	-1
b-cell depletion and immunomodulation before initiation of enzyme replacement therapy blocks the immune response to acid alpha-glucosidase in infantile-onset pompe disease.  to evaluate whether b-cell depletion before enzyme replacement therapy (ert) initiation can block acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) antibody responses and improve clinical outcomes. six subjects with pompe disease (including 4 cross-reacting immunologic material-negative infants) aged 2-8 months received rituximab and sirolimus or mycophenolate before ert. four subjects continued to receive sirolimus, rituximab every 12 weeks, and intravenous immunoglobulin monthly for the duration of ert. sirolimus trough levels, igg, cd3, cd4, cd8, cd19, cd20, n-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase, creatine kinase-mb, c-reactive protein, platelets, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were measured regularly. immunomodulation achieved b-cell depletion without adverse effects. after 17-36 months of rituximab, sirolimus and ert, all subjects lacked antibodies against gaa, 4 continued to gain motor milestones, yet 2 progressed to require invasive ventilation. the absence of infusion-associated reactions allowed the use of accelerated infusion rates. b-cell depletion and t-cell immunomodulation in infants nave to ert was accomplished safely and eliminated immune responses against gaa, thereby optimizing clinical outcome; however, this approach did not necessarily influence sustained independent ventilation. importantly, study outcomes support the initiation of immunomodulation before starting ert, because the study regimen allowed for prompt initiation of treatment.	1
gene mutations in apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  nonobstructive hypertrophy localized to the cardiac apex is an uncommon morphological variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) that often is further distinguished by distinct giant negative t waves and a benign clinical course. the genetic relationship between hcm with typical hypertrophic morphology versus isolated apical hypertrophy is incompletely understood. genetic cause was investigated in 15 probands with apical hypertrophy by dna sequence analyses of 9 sarcomere protein genes and 3 other genes (gla, prkag2, and lamp2) implicated in idiopathic cardiac hypertrophy. six sarcomere gene mutations were found in 7 samples; no samples contained mutations in gla, prkag2, or lamp2. clinical evaluations demonstrated familial apical hcm in 4 probands, and in 3 probands disease-causing mutations were identified. two families shared a cardiac actin glu101lys missense mutation; all members of both families with clinical manifestations of hcm (n=16) had apical hypertrophy. an essential light chain missense mutation met149val caused apical or midventricular segment hcm in another proband and 5 family members, but 6 other affected relatives had typical hcm morphologies. no other sarcomere gene mutations identified in the remaining probands caused apical hcm in other family members. sarcomere protein gene mutations that cause apical hypertrophy rather than more common hcm morphologies reflect interactions among genetic etiology, background modifier genes, and/or hemodynamic factors. only a limited number of sarcomere gene defects (eg, cardiac actin glu101lys) consistently produce apical hcm.	-1
palb2, which encodes a brca2-interacting protein, is a breast cancer susceptibility gene.  palb2 interacts with brca2, and biallelic mutations in palb2 (also known as fancn), similar to biallelic brca2 mutations, cause fanconi anemia. we identified monoallelic truncating palb2 mutations in 10/923 individuals with familial breast cancer compared with 0/1,084 controls (p = 0.0004) and show that such mutations confer a 2.3-fold higher risk of breast cancer (95% confidence interval (c.i.) = 1.4-3.9, p = 0.0025). the results show that palb2 is a breast cancer susceptibility gene and further demonstrate the close relationship of the fanconi anemia-dna repair pathway and breast cancer predisposition.	1
recurrent mutation, gene conversion, or recombination at the human phenylalanine hydroxylase locus: evidence in french-canadians and a catalog of mutations.  the codon 408 mutation (cgg----tgg, arg----trp) in exon 12 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene occurs on haplotype 1 in french-canadians; elsewhere this mutation (r408w) occurs on haplotype 2. a cpg dinucleotide is involved. the finding is compatible with a recurrent mutation, gene conversion, or a single recombination between haplotypes 2 and 1. a tabulation of 20 known mutations at the pah locus reveals three instances of putative recurrent mutation.	-1
caffeine and halothane sensitivity of intracellular ca2+ release is altered by 15 calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor) mutations associated with malignant hyperthermia and/or central core disease.  malignant hyperthermia (mh) and central core disease (ccd) are autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal muscle in which a potentially fatal hypermetabolic crisis can be triggered by commonly used anesthetic agents. to date, 17 mutations in the human ryr1 gene encoding the ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (the ryanodine receptor) have been associated with mh and/or ccd. although many of these mutations have been linked to mh and/or ccd, with high lod (log of the odds favoring linkage versus nonlinkage) scores, others have been found in single, small families. independent biochemical evidence for a causal role for these mutations in mh is available for only two mutants. mutations corresponding to the human mh mutations were made in a full-length rabbit ryr1 cdna, and wild type and mutant cdnas were transfected into hek-293 cells. after about 48 h, intact cells were loaded with the fluorescent ca2+ indicator, fura-2, and intracellular ca2+ release, induced by caffeine or halothane, was measured by photometry. ca2+ release in cells expressing mh or ccd mutant ryanodine receptors was invariably significantly more sensitive to low concentrations of caffeine and halothane than ca2+ release in cells expressing wild type receptors or receptors mutated in other regions of the molecule. linear regression analysis showed that there is a strong correlation (r = 0.95, p < 0.001) between caffeine sensitivity of different ryr1 mutants measured by the cellular ca2+ photometry assay and by the clinical in vitro caffeine halothane contracture test (ivct). the correlation was weaker, however, for halothane (r = 0.49, p > 0.05). abnormal sensitivity in the ca2+ photometry assay provides supporting evidence for a causal role in mh for each of 15 single amino acid mutations in the ryanodine receptor. the study demonstrates the usefulness of the cellular ca2+ photometry assay in the assessment of the sensitivity to caffeine and halothane of specific ryanodine receptor mutants.	1
genetic testing for dilated cardiomyopathy in clinical practice.  familial involvement is common in dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) and >40 genes have been implicated in causing disease. however, the role of genetic testing in clinical practice is not well defined. we examined the experience of clinical genetic testing in a diverse dcm population to characterize the prevalence and predictors of gene mutations. we studied 264 unrelated adult and pediatric dcm index patients referred to 1 reference lab for clinical genetic testing. up to 10 genes were analyzed (myh7, tnnt2, tnni3, tpm1, mybpc3, actc, lmna, pln, taz, and ldb3), and 70% of patients were tested for all genes. the mean age was 26.6  21.3 years, and 52% had a family history of dcm. rigorous criteria were used to classify dna variants as clinically relevant (mutations), variants of unknown clinical significance (vus), or presumed benign. mutations were found in 17.4% of patients, commonly involving myh7, lmna, or tnnt2 (78%). an additional 10.6% of patients had vus. genetic testing was rarely positive in older patients without a family history of dcm. conversely in pediatric patients, family history did not increase the sensitivity of genetic testing. using rigorous criteria for classifying dna variants, mutations were identified in 17% of a diverse group of dcm index patients referred for clinical genetic testing. the low sensitivity of genetic testing in dcm reflects limitations in both current methodology and knowledge of dcm-associated genes. however, if mutations are identified, genetic testing can help guide family management.	-1
inherited p53 gene mutations in breast cancer.  recent evidence has implicated germ-line mutations of the p53 gene as the cause of cancer susceptibility in the li-fraumeni syndrome, associated with the development of breast cancer and other neoplasms. furthermore, somatic mutations of the p53 gene have been detected in a high percentage of non-familial breast cancers. we therefore sought to identify potential carriers of p53 gene mutations in a cohort of patients with early onset breast cancer. we examined 126 consecutive patients who developed breast cancer at or before the age of 40 for mutations of p53 within conserved regions of the gene. one patient with an inherited germ-line mutation of the p53 gene was identified but the functional significance of this mutation was not clear. it thus appears that only a small percentage of patients with breast cancer under the age of 40 carry germ-line mutations of the p53 gene, an observation which has implications for potential screening and risk assessment in such patients.	-1
ptpn11 mutations in noonan syndrome: molecular spectrum, genotype-phenotype correlation, and phenotypic heterogeneity.  noonan syndrome (ns) is a developmental disorder characterized by facial dysmorphia, short stature, cardiac defects, and skeletal malformations. we recently demonstrated that mutations in ptpn11, the gene encoding the non-receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase shp-2 (src homology region 2-domain phosphatase-2), cause ns, accounting for approximately 50% of cases of this genetically heterogeneous disorder in a small cohort. all mutations were missense changes and clustered at the interacting portions of the amino-terminal src-homology 2 (n-sh2) and protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) domains. a gain of function was postulated as a mechanism for the disease. here, we report the spectrum and distribution of ptpn11 mutations in a large, well-characterized cohort with ns. mutations were found in 54 of 119 (45%) unrelated individuals with sporadic or familial ns. there was a significantly higher prevalence of mutations among familial cases than among sporadic ones. all defects were missense, and several were recurrent. the vast majority of mutations altered amino acid residues located in or around the interacting surfaces of the n-sh2 and ptp domains, but defects also affected residues in the c-sh2 domain, as well as in the peptide linking the n-sh2 and c-sh2 domains. genotype-phenotype analysis revealed that pulmonic stenosis was more prevalent among the group of subjects with ns who had ptpn11 mutations than it was in the group without them (70.6% vs. 46.2%; p<.01), whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was less prevalent among those with ptpn11 mutations (5.9% vs. 26.2%; p<.005). the prevalence of other congenital heart malformations, short stature, pectus deformity, cryptorchidism, and developmental delay did not differ between the two groups. a ptpn11 mutation was identified in a family inheriting noonan-like/multiple giant-cell lesion syndrome, extending the phenotypic range of disease associated with this gene.	-1
a large cohort study of gjb2 mutations in japanese hearing loss patients.  gjb2 is the gene most frequently associated with hereditary hearing loss, and the gjb2 mutation spectrums vary among different ethnic groups. in this study, the mutation spectrum as well as clinical features of patients with gjb2 mutations as found in more than 1000 japanese hearing loss families are summarized. the present results show that the frequency of gjb2 mutations in the japanese population with hearing loss is 14.2% overall and 25.2% in patients with congenital hearing loss. c.235delc was the most frequent allele (49.8%), was associated with a more severe phenotype, and was mainly found in patients who were diagnosed by the age of 3. in contrast, the second most frequent was p.v37i (16.5%), which has a milder phenotype and was mainly found in patients diagnosed at a higher age. additional clinical features in hearing loss patients with gjb2 mutations in this study were the near absence of tinnitus, vestibular dysfunction and inner ear malformations.	-1
myosin binding protein c mutations and compound heterozygosity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  we sought to determine the frequency and phenotype of mutations in myosin binding protein c (mybpc3) in a large outpatient cohort of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) seen at our tertiary referral center. mutations in mybpc3 are one of the most frequent genetic causes of hcm and have been associated with variable onset of disease and prognosis. however, the frequency of mutations and associated clinical presentation have not been established in a large, unrelated cohort of patients. using deoxyribonucleic acid from 389 unrelated patients with hcm, each protein coding exon of mybpc3 was analyzed for mutations by polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing. clinical data were extracted from patient records blinded to patient genotype. of 389 patients with hcm, 71 (18%) had mutations in mybpc3. in all, 46 mutations were identified, 33 of which were novel (72%). patients with mybpc3 mutations did not differ significantly from patients with thick filament-hcm, thin filament-hcm, or genotype-negative hcm with respect to age at diagnosis, degree of hypertrophy, incidence of myectomy, or family history of hcm or sudden death. patients with multiple mutations (n = 10, 2.6%) had the most severe disease presentation. this study defines the frequency and associated phenotype for mybpc3 and/or multiple mutations in hcm in the largest cohort to date. in this cohort, unrelated patients with mybpc3-hcm virtually mimicked the phenotype of those with mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain. patients with multiple mutations had the most severe phenotype.	-1
screening for ps1 mutations in a referral-based series of ad cases: 21 novel mutations.  mutations in the presenilin-1 gene (ps1) account for a majority of patients with early-onset familial ad. however, the clinical indications and algorithms for genetic testing in dementia are still evolving. the entire open reading frame of the ps1 gene was sequenced in a series of 414 consecutive patients referred for diagnostic testing, including 372 patients with ad and 42 asymptomatic persons with a strong family history of ad. forty-eight independent patients screened had a ps1 mutation including 21 novel mutations. in addition, 3% of subjects (11/413) had a known polymorphism, the glu318gly substitution. the majority of the mutations were missense substitutions but there were three insertions and delta exon 10 mutation. with six exceptions (codons 35, 178, 352, 354, 358, and 365) most of the mutations occurred at residues conserved in the homologous ps2 gene or in ps1 of other species. eleven percent of a referral-based series of patients with ad can be explained by coding sequence mutations in the ps1 gene. the high frequency of ps1 mutations in this study indicates that screening for ps1 mutations in ad is likely to be successful, especially when directed at patients with a positive family history with onset before 60 years (90% of those with ps1 mutations were affected by age 60 years). this will also have significance for the secondary identification of at-risk relatives who might be candidates for future prophylactic therapies for ad.	-1
screening of myh7, mybpc3, and tnnt2 genes in brazilian patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hc) is the most prevalent genetic cardiac disease caused by a mutation in sarcomeres, z-disks, or calcium-handling genes and is characterized by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. the aim of this study was to determine the genetic profile of brazilian patients with hc and correlate the genotype with the phenotype. we included 268 index patients from so paulo city and 3 other cities in brazil and extracted their dna from whole blood. we amplified the coding sequencing of myh7, mybpc3, and tnnt2 genes and sequenced them with an automatic sequencer. we identified causal mutations in 131 patients (48.8%). seventy-eight (59.5%) were in the myh7 gene, 50 (38.2%) in the mybpc3 gene, and 3 (2.3%) in the tnnt2 gene. we identified 69 mutations, 24 not previously described. patients with an identified mutation were younger at diagnosis and at current age, had a higher mean heart rate and higher nonsustained ventricular tachycardia frequency compared with those without a mutation. patients with myh7 gene mutations had a larger left atrium and higher frequency of atrial fibrillation than did patients with mybpc3 gene mutations. the presence of a mutation in one of the genes suggests a worse prognosis. mutations in the myh7 gene, rather than in the mybpc3 gene, were also related to a worse prognosis. this is the first work characterizing hc molecular epidemiology in the brazilian population for the 3 most important genes.	-1
unresponsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  conflicting results have been reported concerning the efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the cofactor of phenylalanine hydroxylase, for reducing phenylalanine (phe) concentration in phenylketonuria (pku). we aimed to test quantitatively the effects of bh4 in pku patients. seven fully characterized patients were selected among a population of 130 pku subjects as harboring pku mutations predicted as bh4 responsive and previously considered responsive to a cofactor challenge. they received a simple phe (100 mg/kg) and 2 combined phe (100 mg/kg) and bh4 (20 mg/kg) oral loading tests. cofactor was administered either before or after the amino acid. the concentrations of phe, tyrosine (tyr), and biopterin were measured over 24 hours after loading. the comparative analysis of the loading tests showed that in all patients plasma phe concentrations peaked within 3 hours, and fell within 24 hours by about 50% in benign, 20% in mild, and 15% in severe phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency regardless of bh4 administration. a consistent or moderate increase of plasma tyr, again independent of the cofactor challenge, was observed only in the less severe forms of pah deficiency. mean blood biopterin concentration increased 6 times after simple phe and 34 to 39 times after combined loading tests. the administration of bh4 does not alter phe and tyr metabolism in pku patients. the clearance of plasma phe after oral loading and, as well as tyr production, is not related to cofactor challenge but to patient's phenotype. the assessment of bh4 responsiveness by the methods so far used is not reliable, and the occurrence of bh4-responsive forms of pku still has to be definitely proven.	-1
long-term outcome of 4 korean families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by 4 different mutations.  we sought to describe the long-term outcome of individuals in 4 korean families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) with known mutations. long-term clinical features of familial hcm might be characterized according to the mutation causing hcm. we performed long-term (mean, 13.1 y) clinical evaluations on 46 subjects from 4 korean families with different mutations. myosin light chain 3 gene (myl3) mutation was associated with late-onset hcm with relatively poor prognosis; 1 sudden cardiac death and 2 cases of heart failure with atrial fibrillation occurred among 12 subjects with this mutation. myosin binding protein c gene (mybpc3) mutation was associated with 2 cases of sudden cardiac death and 3 cases of heart failure among 7 affected members. cardiac troponin i type 3 gene (tnni3) mutation was associated with 5 deaths related to atrial fibrillation and stroke among 12 mutation-positive members. myosin heavy chain 7 gene (myh7) mutation was associated with 11 deaths in 15 affected members. the clinical course was quite different for different hcm mutations. even within the same family, individuals carrying the same mutation differed in disease expression and prognosis.	-1
genetic screening protocol for familial hypercholesterolemia which includes splicing defects gives an improved mutation detection rate.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a common single gene disorder, which predisposes to coronary artery disease. in a previous study, we have shown that in patients with definite fh around 20% had no identifiable gene defect after screening the entire exon coding area of the low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and testing for the common apolipoprotein b (apob) r3500q mutation. in this study, we have extended the screen to additional families and have included the non-coding intron splice regions of the gene. in families with definite fh (tendon xanthoma present, n=68) the improved genetic screening protocol increased the detection rate of mutations to 87%. this high detection rate greatly enhances the potential value of this test as part of a clinical screening program for fh. in contrast, the use of a limited screen in patients with possible fh (n=130) resulted in a detection rate of 26%, but this is still of significant benefit in diagnosis of this genetic condition. we have also shown that 14% of ldlr defects are due to splice site mutations and that the most frequent splice mutation in our series (c.1845+11 c>g) is expressed at the rna level. in addition, dna samples from the patients in whom no ldlr or apob gene mutations were found, were sequenced for the narc-1 gene. no mutations were identified which suggests that the role of narc-1 in causing fh is minor. in a small proportion of families (<10%) the genetic cause of the high cholesterol remains unknown, and other genes are still to be identified that could cause the clinical phenotype fh.	-1
protein tyrosine phosphatase shp2/ptpn11 mistargeting as a consequence of sh2-domain point mutations associated with noonan syndrome and leukemia.  shp2/ptpn11 is a key regulator of cytokine, growth factor and integrin signaling. shp2 influences cell survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating major signaling pathways. mutations in ptpn11 cause severe diseases like noonan, leopard syndrome or leukemia. whereas several of these mutations result in altered enzymatic activity due to impaired auto-inhibition, not all disease patterns can be explained by this mechanism. in this study we analyzed altered binding properties of disease-related shp2-mutants bearing point mutations within the sh2-domain (t42a, e139d, and r138q). mutants were chosen according to spr assays, which revealed different binding properties of mutated sh2 towards phosphorylated receptor peptides. to analyze global changes in mutant binding properties we applied quantitative mass spectrometry (silac). using an in vitro approach we identified overall more than 1000 protein candidates, which specifically bind to the sh2-domain of shp2. we discovered that mutations in the sh2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment by altering the binding capacity of the sh2-domain. mutation-dependent, enhanced or reduced exposure of shp2 to its binding partners could have an impact on the dynamics of signaling networks. thus, disease-associated mutants of shp2 should not only be discussed in the context of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting of the shp2 mutants. using quantitative mass spectrometry based proteomics we provided evidence that disease related mutations in shp2 domains of shp2 are able to influence shp2 recruitment to its targets in mutation dependent manner. we discovered that mutations in the sh2-domain selectively affected protein enrichment ratios suggesting altered binding properties of the sh2-domain. we demonstrated that mutations within shp2, which had been attributed to affect the enzymatic activity (i.e. affect the open/close status of shp2), also differ in respect to binding properties. our study indicates that shp2 mutations need to be discussed not only in terms of deregulated auto-inhibition but also with respect to deregulated protein targeting properties of the shp2 mutants. discovery of the new binding partners for disease-related shp2 mutants might provide a fruitful foundation for developing strategies targeting noonan-associated leukemia.	1
identification of three novel missense pku mutations among chinese.  three novel missense mutations have been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) genes of chinese individuals afflicted with various degrees of phenylketonuria (pku). a t-to-c transition was observed in exon 5 of the gene, resulting in the substitution of phe161 by ser161. two substitutions, g-to-t and t-to-g, were observed in exon 7, resulting in the substitution of gly247 by val247 and leu255 by val255, respectively. expression analysis demonstrated that these mutant proteins produced between 0 and 15% of normal pah enzyme activity. population screening of a chinese sample population indicates that these mutations are quite rare, together accounting for only about 4% of all pku alleles among the chinese. the p161s and g247v mutations were each present on a single pah rflp haplotype 4 chromosome in patients form northern china, while the l255v mutation was present on chromosomes of both haplotypes 18 and 21 in patients from southern china. these results suggest that the remaining 30% of uncharacterized pku alleles in the chinese population may bear a large number of relatively rare pah mutations.	1
li-fraumeni and li-fraumeni-like syndrome among children diagnosed with pediatric cancer in southern brazil.  pediatric cancers are a feature in patients with li-fraumeni syndrome and its variant li-fraumeni-like syndrome (lfs/lfl). to the best of the authors' knowledge, tp53 germline mutations are currently the only molecular defect known to be associated with this disease. recently, a specific germline mutation in this gene, p.r337h, has been reported at a high prevalence in brazil. the prevalence of lfs/lfl was investigated in children with cancer who were diagnosed with tumors on the lfs/lfl spectrum and in a small consecutive series of controls without cancer. the prevalence of the germline p.r337h mutation and of other germline tp53 mutations was investigated in a general group of children with cancer and exclusively in children fulfilling the clinical criteria for lfs/lfl, respectively. among the 65 children without cancer, 1.5% had a family history of lfl whereas of the 292 children with cancer, 25.3% had a family history of lfl (p < .001). screening for the p.r337h mutation identified 11 carriers (3.7%), 9 of whom were diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinomas (acc) and 2 of whom were diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinomas. one of the acc probands was homozygous mutant. the brazilian founder haplotype and loss of heterozygosity at the p.r337h locus were present in all carriers. in addition, direct sequencing of the entire tp53 coding region and gene rearrangement analysis of probands fulfilling the criteria for lfl (eeles 2 criteria, birch and/or chompret criteria) and who were negative for the p.r337h mutation revealed a dna-binding domain pathogenic mutation, p.g245s, in 1 child. tp53 p.r337h testing should be offered to brazilian children diagnosed with acc and choroid plexus carcinoma. a significant percentage of children with cancer in southern brazil fulfill the criteria for lfl and should be referred for genetic risk assessment.	-1
[analysis of myh7, mybpc3 and tnnt2 gene mutations in 10 chinese pedigrees with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the correlation between genotype and phenotype].  the aim of this study was to screen the disease-causing gene mutations and investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation in 10 chinese pedigrees with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm). there are 91 family members from these 10 pedigrees and 5 members were normal mutated carriers, 23 members were hcm patients (14 male) aged from 1.5 to 73 years old. the functional regions of myosin heavy chain gene (myh7), cardiac myosin-binding protein c (mybpc3) and cardiac troponin t gene (tnnt2) were screened with pcr and direct sequencing technique. clinical information from all patients was also evaluated in regard to the genotype. mutations were found in 5 out of 10 pedigrees. mutations in myh7 (arg663his, glu924lys and ile736thr) were found in 3 pedigrees and 3 patients from these pedigrees suffered sudden death at age 20-48 years old during sport. mutations in mybpc3 were found in 2 pedigrees, 1 with complex mutation (arg502trp and splicing mutation ivs27 + 12c > t) and 1 with novel frame shift mutation (gly347fs) and the latter pedigree has sudden death history. no mutation was identified in tnnt2. although the han chinese is a relatively homogeneous ethnic group, different hcm gene mutations were responsible for familiar hcm suggesting the heterogeneity nature of the disease-causing genes and hcm myh7 mutations are associated with a higher risk of sudden death in this cohort. furthermore, identical mutation might result in different phenotypes suggesting that multiple factors might be involved in the pathogenesis of familiar hcm.	-1
temporal repolarization lability in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by beta-myosin heavy-chain gene mutations.  certain genetic mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) carry an increased risk of sudden death. qt variability identifies patients at a high risk for sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias. we tested whether patients with hcm caused by beta-myosin heavy-chain (beta-mhc) gene mutations exhibit labile ventricular repolarization using beat-to-beat qt variability analysis. we measured the qt variability index and heart rate-qt interval coherence from holter monitor recordings in 36 patients with hcm caused by known beta-mhc gene mutations and in 26 age- and sex-matched controls. there were 7 distinct beta-mhc gene mutations in these 36 patients; 9 patients had hcm caused by the malignant arg(403)gln mutation and 8 patients had hcm caused by the more benign leu(908)val mutation. the qt variability index was higher in hcm patients than in controls (-1.24+/-0.17 versus -1. 58+/-0.38, p<0.01), and the greatest abnormality was detected in patients with the arg(403)gln mutation (-0.99+/-0.49 versus -1. 46+/-0.43 in controls, p<0.05). in keeping with this finding, coherence was lower for the entire hcm group than for controls (p<0. 001). coherence was also significantly lower in patients with the arg(403)gln mutation compared with controls (p<0.05). these findings suggest that (1) patients with hcm caused by beta-mhc gene mutations exhibit labile repolarization quantified by qt variability analysis and, hence, may be more at risk for sudden death from ventricular arrhythmias, and (2) indices of qt variability may be particularly abnormal in patients with beta-mhc gene mutations that are associated with a poor prognosis.	-1
whole-body muscle mri in 20 patients suffering from late onset pompe disease: involvement patterns.  to describe muscle involvement on whole-body mri scans in adult patients at different stages of late-onset pompe disease. twenty patients aged 37 to 75 were examined. five were bedridden and required ventilatory support. axial and coronal t1 turbo-spin-echo sequences were performed on 1.5t or 3t systems. mri was scored for 47 muscles using mercuri's classification. whole-body scans were obtained with a mean in-room time of 29 min. muscle changes consisted of internal bright signals of fatty replacement without severe retraction of the muscles' corpus. findings were consistent with previous descriptions of spine extensors and pelvic girdle, but also provided new information on recurrent muscle changes particularly in the tongue and subscapularis muscle. moreover thigh involvement was more heterogeneous than previously described, in terms of distribution across muscles as well as with respect to the overall clinical presentation. whole-body mri provides a very evocative description of muscle involvement in pompe disease in adults.	-1
right ventricular hypertrophy, systolic function, and disease severity in anderson-fabry disease: an echocardiographic study.  right ventricular (rv) involvement has been described in anderson-fabry disease (afd), especially in patients with established fabry cardiomyopathy (fc). however, few and controversial data on rv systolic function are available, and there are no specific tissue doppler studies. detailed echocardiographic examinations were performed in 45 patients with afd. fc, defined as maximal left ventricular wall thickness ? 15 mm, was present in 12. the mainz severity score index was calculated for each patient. pulsed tissue doppler was applied to the rv free wall at the tricuspid annular level and at the septal and lateral corners at the mitral annular level to obtain systolic tissue doppler velocities (rv sa, septal sa, and lateral sa, respectively). twelve patients with amyloid light-chain cardiac amyloidosis were studied as a control group. echocardiography revealed rv hypertrophy (rvh) in 31% of patients with afd, all but one of whom were male and all of whom had concomitant left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). all patients with afd had normal rv fractional area change (47.9  6.5%) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (21.7  3.2 mm) and all but one also had normal rv sa (13.2  2.2 cm/sec). rvh positively correlated with indices of lvh (r = 0.8, p = .0001, for all parameters evaluated), as well as with mainz severity score index (r = 0.70, p = .0001). septal and lateral sa were decreased in almost all patients (means, 7.7  1.8 and 7.9  1.9 cm/sec, respectively), irrespective of the presence of lvh. compared with control subjects with cardiac amyloidosis, patients with fc showed better indices of rv systolic function (p < .001 for all: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, rv fractional area change, and rv sa) despite similar rv wall thickness (6.2  1.2 vs 6.9  1.9 mm, p = ns). rvh is common in patients with afd and correlates with disease severity and lvh. rvh, however, does not significantly affect rv systolic function. patients with fc have better rv systolic function compared with those with cardiac amyloidosis with similar levels of rv thickness. the combination of low lv sa values and normal rv sa values might be helpful in the differential diagnosis of infiltrative heart disease.	-1
gt to at transition at a splice donor site causes skipping of the preceding exon in phenylketonuria.  classical phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). we isolated several mutant pah cdna clones from a pku carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal pah gene. the deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the c-terminal 52 amino acids. gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant pah cdna indicated that the deletion abolishes pah activity in the cell as a result of protein instability. to determine the molecular basis of the deletion, the mutant chromosomal pah gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a gt-- greater than at substitution at the 5' splice donor site of intron 12. thus, the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during rna splicing.	1
non-phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninaemia in northern ireland: frequent mutation allows screening and early diagnosis.  up to 10% of newborn children with a positive guthrie test have non-phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninaemia, i.e., mild elevation of serum phenylalanine that does not require dietary treatment. depending on the relative frequencies of different phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in a particular population, non-pku hpa is usually caused by the combined effect of a mild hpa mutation and a severe pku mutation. presented here is a comprehensive analysis of non-pku hpa in northern ireland. of particular interest is one prevalent hpa mutation (t380m), which is present in over 70% of non-pku hpa patients in northern ireland. screening for this mutation is easy and inexpensive and can help confirm the diagnosis of non-pku hyperphenylalaninaemia in the majority of cases at a very early stage. this may be clinically useful and reassuring for the parents. other mutations described are v245a, l194p, and e390g.	-1
"the landscape of genetic diseases in saudi arabia based on the first 1000 diagnostic panels and exomes.  in this study, we report the experience of the only reference clinical next-generation sequencing lab in saudi arabia with the first 1000 families who span a wide-range of suspected mendelian phenotypes. a total of 1019 tests were performed in the period of march 2016-december 2016 comprising 972 solo (index only), 14 duo (parents or affected siblings only), and 33 trio (index and parents). multigene panels accounted for 672 tests, while whole exome sequencing (wes) represented the remaining 347 tests. pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants that explain the clinical indications were identified in 34% (27% in panels and 43% in exomes), spanning 279 genes and including 165 novel variants. while recessive mutations dominated the landscape of solved cases (71% of mutations, and 97% of which are homozygous), a substantial minority (27%) were solved on the basis of dominant mutations. the highly consanguineous nature of the study population also facilitated homozygosity for many private mutations (only 32.5% of the recessive mutations are founder), as well as the first instances of recessive inheritance of previously assumed strictly dominant disorders (involving itpr1, vamp1, mctp2, and tbp). surprisingly, however, dual molecular diagnosis was only observed in 1.5% of cases. finally, we have encountered candidate variants in 75 genes (abhd6, acy3, adgrb2, adgrg7, agtpbp1, ahnak2, akap6, asb3, atxn1l, c17orf62, cabp1, ccdc186, ccp110, clstn2, cntn3, cntn5, ctnna2, cwc22, dmap1, dmkn, dmxl1, dscam, dvl2, eci1, ep400, epb41l5, fbxl22, gap43, gemin7, git1, grik4, grsf1, gtrp1, hid1, ifnl1, kcnc4, lrrc52, map7d3, mctp2, med26, mpp7, mrps35, mtdh, mtmr9, necap2, npat, nrap, pax7, pcnx, plch2, plekhf1, ptpn12, qki, rilpl2, rimkla, rims2, rnf213, robo1, sec16a, siah1, sirt2, slain2, slc22a20, smdt1, srrt, sstr1, st20, syt9, tspan6, ubr4, vamp4, vps36, wdr59, wdyhv1, and whsc1) not previously linked to human phenotypes and these are presented to accelerate post-publication matchmaking. two of these genes were independently mutated in more than one family with similar phenotypes, which substantiates their link to human disease (akap6 in intellectual disability and ubr4 in early dementia). if the novel candidate disease genes in this cohort are independently confirmed, the yield of wes will have increased to 83%, which suggests that most ""negative"" clinical exome tests are unsolved due to interpretation rather than technical limitations."	-1
pku in minas gerais state, brazil: mutation analysis.  this work was undertaken in order to ascertain the pku mutational spectrum in minas gerais, brazil, the relative frequency of the mutations in the state and the origin of these mutations by haplotype determination. minas gerais is a trihybrid population formed by miscegenation from europeans, africans and amerindians. all 13 exons of the pah gene from 78 pku patients were analyzed, including splicing sites and the promoter region. we identified 30 different mutations and 98% of the pah alleles were established. a new mutation (q267x) was identified as well. the most common mutations found were v388m (21.2), r261q (16.0%), ivs10-11g>a (15.3%), i65t (5.8%), ivs2+5g>c (5.8%), r252w (5.1%), ivs2+5g>a (4.5%), p281l (3.8%) and l348v (3.2%). these nine mutations correspond to 80% of the pku alleles in the state. haplotypes were determined to characterize the origin of the pah alleles. the majority of the mutations found, with respective haplotypes, are frequent in the iberian peninsula. however, there were some mutations that are rare in europe and four previously unreported mutation-haplotype associations. i65t and q267x were found in association with haplotype 38 and may be african in origin or the result of miscegenation in the brazilian population.	-1
improvement of dysphagia in a child affected by pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy.  dysphagia is a known complication in pompe disease (pd), a severe metabolic myopathy due to alpha-glucosidase deficiency. enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with alglucosidase alfa is the only approved therapy for pd. presently no data are available on the effects of ert on dysphagia in pd patients. the aim of this work is to evaluate the course of this complication in a 6 years old boy affected by pd after treatment with ert. dysphagia was assessed by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (vfss) at baseline, before the start of ert and after 36 months of therapy. we used the dysphagia severity rating scale (dss) to define the severity grade of dysphagia. vfss performed at baseline revealed complete incoordination of oral stage swallowing which was classified as a grade 1 dysphagia according to dss. after 36 months of treatment vfss revealed normal swallowing, classified as grade 0 by dss. our results suggest that ert is effective in improving dysphagia. vfss may be a useful tool to investigate and monitor swallowing disorders in patients affected by pd.	-1
reduced penetrance of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia in a high percentage of families: importance of genetic testing in the entire family.  autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemias (adhs) are characterised by increased plasma levels of total and ldl cholesterol, predisposing to premature atherosclerosis. adhs comprise several diseases with undistinguishable phenotype, caused by mutations in different genes: ldlr, apob and pcsk9. genetic studies are usually performed in patients with altered cholesterol levels. however, some persons carrying pathogenic mutations are normocholesterolemic and there are no further studies about this subject. we have studied the frequency of families and individuals carrying adh mutations who do not present the disease in spanish population. we have analysed genes known to cause adh by direct sequencing in 24 adh families (215 members). functional effect of some ldlr gene mutations was assessed by transfecting cultured cells with plasmids. six families with mutations presented 7 mutation carriers who did not show adh phenotype: 30% of adh families presented normocholesterolemic individuals, and 7% of carriers of pathogenic mutations did not show adh phenotype. we have analysed the effect of some of these mutations and they are responsible for impaired ldl receptor function. we have excluded mutations in apob and pcsk9 genes that could reduce ldlc levels. an important percentage of adh families presented individuals who do not show an adh phenotype, but who are able to transmit the pathogenic mutation to their offspring. genetic study of all subjects in adh families should be performed in order to identify normocholesterolemic carriers that allow the detection of mutations in their descendants and the prevention of the disease consequences.	-1
sequence variation at the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in the british isles.  using mutation and haplotype analysis, we have examined the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in the phenylketonuria populations of four geographical areas of the british isles: the west of scotland, southern wales, and southwestern and southeastern england. the enormous genetic diversity of this locus within the british isles is demonstrated in the large number of different mutations characterized and in the variety of genetic backgrounds on which individual mutations are found. allele frequencies of the more common mutations exhibited significant nonrandom distribution in a north/south differentiation. differences between the west of scotland and southwestern england may be related to different events in the recent and past histories of their respective populations. similarities between southern wales and southeastern england are likely to reflect the heterogeneity that is seen in and around two large capital cities. finally, comparison with more recently colonized areas of the world corroborates the genealogical origin by range expansion of several mutations.	-1
spectrum of mutations in noonan syndrome and their correlation with phenotypes.  to investigate mutation spectrums and their correlations to phenotypes in noonan syndrome (ns) and ns-related disorders that share functional alterations of the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. clinical characteristics and genotypes of 10 previously known and 2 candidate genes, spry1-4 and spred1, were investigated in 59 patients with ns, 17 with cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, 5 with costello syndrome, and 2 with leopard syndrome. ptpn11 (39.0%), sos1 (20.3%), raf1 (6.8%), kras (5.1%), and braf (1.7%) mutations were identified in ns; braf (41.2%), shoc2 (23.5%), and mek1 (5.9%) mutations in cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome; and hras and ptpn11 mutations in costello syndrome and leopard syndrome, respectively. no additional mutations were identified in 28.9% of ns and 35.3% of cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. functional characterizations of 2 raf1 novel variants, p.p261t and p.s259t, and one sos1 variant, p.k170e, showed enhanced activity of ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. normal stature was frequent in sos1 mutations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in raf1, and developmental delay in raf1, braf, or shoc2 mutations. by identifying genotype-phenotype correlations, our study highlights the role of molecular genetic testing in the process of differential diagnosis of ns and ns-related disorders. pathophysiologies that underlie these correlations are needed to be investigated in terms of their effects on ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.	1
ethylmalonic encephalopathy: application of improved biochemical and molecular diagnostic approaches.  ethylmalonic encephalopathy (ee, omim # 602473) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder of infancy affecting the brain, the gastrointestinal tract and peripheral vessels. it is caused by a defect in the ethe1 gene product, which was recently shown to be part of a metabolic pathway devoted to sulphide detoxification. we report the application of improved biochemical and molecular approaches to the diagnosis of three cases of ee from two unrelated cypriot families. the children presented all the typical biochemical hallmarks of the disease including elevated lactate and butyrylcarnitine in blood and elevated urinary excretion of ethylmalonic acid, 2-methylsuccinate, isobutyrylglycine and isovalerylglycine. we also detected an elevated level of thiosulphate in urine, which we propose as an additional biochemical marker of the disease. the proband of the first family was shown to be a compound heterozygote for a missense mutation in exon 5, l185r, and a deletion of exon 4. the deletion was identified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-pcr). using the same technique, the proband of the second family was found to be homozygous for the exon 4 deletion. a prenatal diagnosis was performed for the second family using qrt-pcr, thus establishing the usefulness of rt-pcr in prenatal diagnosis.	-1
germline tp53 variants and susceptibility to osteosarcoma.  the etiologic contribution of germline genetic variation to sporadic osteosarcoma is not well understood. osteosarcoma is a sentinel cancer of li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs), in which approximately 70% of families meeting the classic criteria have germline tp53 mutations. we sequenced tp53 exons in 765 osteosarcoma cases. data were analyzed with ?(2) tests, logistic regression, and cox proportional hazards regression models. we observed a high frequency of young osteosarcoma cases (age <30 years) carrying a known lfs- or likely lfs-associated mutation (3.8%) or rare exonic variant (5.7%) with an overall frequency of 9.5%, compared with none in case patients age 30 years and older (p < .001). this high tp53 mutation prevalence in young osteosarcoma cases is statistically significantly greater than the previously reported prevalence of 3% (p = .0024). we identified a novel association between a tp53 rare variant and metastasis at diagnosis of osteosarcoma (rs1800372, odds ratio = 4.27, 95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 15.5, p = .026). genetic susceptibility to young onset osteosarcoma is distinct from older adult onset osteosarcoma, with a high frequency of lfs-associated and rare exonic tp53 variants.	-1
evaluation of the mayo clinic phenotype-based genotype predictor score in patients with clinically diagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) can provide an important clinical marker for disease outcome and family screening. this study set out to validate our recently developed phenotype-based hcm genotype predictor score. patients clinically diagnosed with hcm and evaluated by genetic counselors comprised the study cohort. genotype score was derived based on clinical and echocardiographic variables. total score was correlated with the yield of genetic testing. of 564 hcm patients, 198 sought genetic testing (35 %; 55 % male; mean age at diagnosis, 50  20 years). of these, 101 patients (51 %) were genotype positive for a hcm-associated genetic mutation (55 % male; mean age at diagnosis, 42  18 years). cochran-armitage analysis showed similar, statistically significant trends of increased yields for higher genotype scores for both the original and study cohort. validated by the current study, this scoring system provides an easy-to-use, clinical tool to aid in determining the likelihood of a positive hcm genetic test.	-1
missense mutations and polymorphisms of the mc4r gene in polish obese children and adolescents in relation to the relative body mass index.  extensive studies of the mc4r gene polymorphism showed that, among numerous variants, there are mutations responsible for monogenic obesity, as well as polymorphisms negatively correlated with the risk of obesity. in this report, we present the first studies of the whole coding sequence of the mc4r gene in 243 polish obese children and adolescents (the mean relative body mass index [rbmi] was 163.6). in addition, 101 non-obese adults were also analyzed. direct sequencing facilitated the identification of six missense (k73r, v103i, t112m, s127l, m215l, and i251l) and one silent (c.756 c > t) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (snps). two non-synonymous polymorphisms (k73r and m215l) appeared to be novel and one was found in obese patients (m215l, one patient) and one in non-obese adults (k73r, one person). the overall frequency of non-synonymous variant carriers reached 4.1% and 6.9% in obese patients and non-obese adults, respectively. only one obesity-associated variant (127l) was found in two obese patients (0.82%) and in two non-obese adults (1.98%). the obesity-protecting variants (103i and 251l) appeared to be the most common in both groups: 3.3% and 4.0%, respectively. it was also observed that the rbmi in obese children and adolescents carrying the minor variants did not differ significantly from the non-carriers; however, the expected trends for the associated and protecting variants were observed. we conclude that the contribution of the mc4r gene variants to the pathogenesis of obesity in polish children and adolescents is low.	-1
low density lipoprotein--receptor (ldl-r) gene mutations among filipinos with familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disease resulting from mutations of the ldl (ldlr) receptor gene leading to a diminished catabolism and elevated level of ldl cholesterol (ldl-c). it is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (cvd). the medped (make early diagnosis-prevent early death) program, an initiative cited by the who human genetics programme in their report on fh, initiated international collaboration to identify and follow-up patients with fh globally. from asia-pacific, only 6 countries are participating and no data among filipinos particularly on genetic profiles is available at present. this study attempts to initiate data collection and participation in the global initiative. primary: 1. to describe the phenotype of filipino patients with fh. 2. to determine and characterize the ldl-r gene mutations among filipino patients with clinical features of fh. secondary: to determine the association of the clinical characteristics of fh with the presence of ldlr gene mutations. cross- sectional study. multicenter, outpatient clinic. 60 unrelated patients, 18 y/o and above from up-pgh, manila doctors hospital and cardinal santos medical center. fh was diagnosed according to the dutch lipid clinic network criteria cited by who which is based on a history of premature cvd, family history, tendon xanthoma, arcus cornealis, and ldl c levels. with informed consent, clinical history, physical examination and lipid profile data were determined. blood samples were extracted, processed to isolate dna specimens at the national institutes of health, institute of human genetics, and sent to canterbury health laboratories at christchurch, new zealand for dna analysis. descriptive statistics, fisher's exact test and student's t-test using stata version 6.0 software. sixty patients with a mean age of 55 y/o were included, including 39 (65%) females. the mean ldl level was 227 mg/dl. cardiovascular disease and a family history of dyslipidemia were present in 55 & 60% of the samples, respectively. twenty percent had documented ldl-r gene mutations. six of the mutations were considered novel. a family history of dyslipidemia, an elevated ldl-c level, and a high fh score exhibited a statistically significant association with mutations. the study population has a high prevalence of cvd at an average age of 55 years with a strong family history of dyslipidemia and very high average ldl-c levels. one out of every 5 patients had ldl-r gene mutations, 6 of which were considered novel. ldl-r gene mutation was significantly associated with family history of dyslipidemia, ldl-c level and fh score. this is the first international collaborative genetic study among filipinos with fh. data could allow the country to participate in the who/medped global program. collaborative efforts will lead to more effective detection, treatment and prevention of cv events. novel mutations were discovered and further analysis of these genes will be done.	-1
common mutations of familial hypercholesterolemia patients in taiwan: characteristics and implications of migrations from southeast china.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), apolipoprotein b-100 (apob), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) genes. this study investigated fh patients carrying common mutations in taiwan and compared them to fh southeastern asians. causal fh mutations were identified by exon-by-exon sequencing with/without multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification among 208 taiwanese with clinically diagnosed fh. haplotype analyses among probands and family members were undertaken using taqman assays. totally, ldlr mutations were found in 118 probands, consisting of 61 different loci, and apob 10579c>t mutations in 12 probands. three mutations (64delg, 1661c>t, and 2099a>g) were novel. ldlr 986g>a (13.1%), 1747c>t (10.8%), and apob 10579c>t (9.2%) were common mutations with no differences in phenotypes. ldlr 1747c>t associated with one haplotype (caagccccatgg/(dta)n-112nt); ldlr 986g>a with two. apob 10579c>t associated with the same ldlr binding-domain pattern in taiwanese and southeastern asians. we concluded that ldlr 986g>a, 1747c>t and apob 10579c>t are common mutations, with combined frequency of approximately 33%. the presence of different haplotypes associated with fh common mutations in taiwan indicates multiple historical migrations, probable multiple recurrent origins from southern china, and haplotype homologies reflect the presence of common ancestors in southern china.	-1
biallelic and heterozygous point mutations in the runt domain of the aml1/pebp2alphab gene associated with myeloblastic leukemias.  the aml1 gene encoding the dna-binding alpha-subunit in the runt domain family of heterodimeric transcription factors has been noted for its frequent involvement in chromosomal translocations associated with leukemia. using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) combined with nonisotopic rnase cleavage assay (nirca), we found point mutations of the aml1 gene in 8 of 160 leukemia patients: silent mutations, heterozygous missense mutations, and biallelic nonsense or frameshift mutations in 2, 4, and 2 cases, respectively. the mutations were all clustered within the runt domain. missense mutations identified in 3 patients showed neither dna binding nor transactivation, although being active in heterodimerization. these defective missense mutants may be relevant to the predisposition or progression of leukemia. on the other hand, the biallelic nonsense mutants encoding truncated aml1 proteins lost almost all functions examined and may play a role in leukemogenesis leading to acute myeloblastic leukemia.	1
phenylketonuria mutations and their relation to rflp haplotypes at the pah locus in czech pku families.  a detailed study of the mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene from the eastern part of the czech republic (moravia) is reported. a total of 190 mutant alleles from 95 phenylketonuria (pku) families were analyzed for 21 prevalent caucasian mutations and restriction fragment length polymorphism/variable number of tandem repeats (rflp/vntr) haplotypes. eighty per cent of all mutant alleles were found to carry 11 mutations. the most common molecular defect was the mutation r408w (55.3%), with a very high degree of homozygosity (34.6%). each of four other mutations (r158q, r243x, g272x, ivs12nt1) accounted for more than 3% of pku alleles. rarely present were mutations ivs10nt546 (2.6%), r252w (2.6%), l48s (2.1%), r261q (1.6%), y414c (1.0%) and 165t (0.5%). mutations that have been predominantly described in southern europe (ivs7nt1, a259v, y277d, r241h, t278n) were not detected. a total of 14 different mutant haplotypes were observed. three unusual genotype-haplotype associations were identified (r158q on haplotypes 2.3 and 7.8 and r252w on haplotype 69.3). there was a strong association between the mutation r408w and haplotype 2.3 (54.7%). heterogeneity was found at mutations r408w (haplotypes 2.3 and 5.9), r158q (haplotypes 4.3, 2.3 and 7.8) and ivs10nt546 (haplotypes 6.7 and 34.7). the molecular basis of pku in the moravian area appears to be relatively homogeneous in comparison with other southern and western european populations, thus providing a good starting point for prenatal diagnosis and early clinical classification.	-1
genetic basis of hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueducts in koreans.  sensorineural hearing loss associated with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (eva) can be associated with mutations of the slc26a4 gene. in western populations, less than one-half of the affected individuals with eva have two mutant slc26a4 alleles, and eva is frequently caused by unknown genetic or environmental factors alone or in combination with a single slc26a4 mutation as part of a complex trait. in this study, we ascertained 26 korean probands with eva and performed nucleotide sequence analysis to detect slc26a4 mutations. all subjects had bilateral eva, and 20 of 26 were sporadic (simplex) cases. fourteen different mutations were identified, including nine novel mutations. five mutations were recurrent and accounted for 80% of all mutant alleles, providing a basis for the design and interpretation of cost-efficient mutation detection algorithms. two mutant alleles were identified in 21 (81%), one mutant allele was detected in three (11%), and zero mutant allele was detected in two (8%) of 26 probands. the high proportion of korean probands with two slc26a4 mutations may reflect a reduced frequency of other genetic or environmental factors causing eva in comparison to western populations.	-1

molecular genetic testing of patients with monogenic diabetes and hyperinsulinism.  genetic sequencing has become a critical part of the diagnosis of certain forms of pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. despite great advances in the speed and cost of dna sequencing, determining the pathogenicity of variants remains a challenge, and requires sharing of sequence and phenotypic data between laboratories. we reviewed all diabetes and hyperinsulinism-associated molecular testing done at the seattle children's molecular genetics laboratory from 2009 to 2013. 331 probands were referred to us for molecular genetic sequencing for neonatal diabetes (ndm), maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody), or congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) during this period. reportable variants were identified in 115 (35%) patients with 91 variants in one of 6 genes: hnf1a, gck, hnf4a, abcc8, kcnj11, or ins. in addition to identifying 23 novel variants, we identified unusual mechanisms of inheritance, including mosaic and digenic mody presentations. re-analysis of all reported variants using more recently available databases led to a change in variant interpretation from the original report in 30% of cases. these results represent a resource for molecular testing of monogenic forms of diabetes and hyperinsulinism, providing a mutation spectrum for these disorders in a large north american cohort. in addition, they highlight the importance of periodic review of molecular testing results.	-1
surgical findings and outcomes in premenopausal breast cancer patients undergoing oophorectomy: a multicenter review from the society of gynecologic surgeons fellows pelvic research network.  to describe the procedures performed, intra-abdominal findings, and surgical pathology in a cohort of women with premenopausal breast cancer who underwent oopherectomy. multicenter retrospective chart review (canadian task force classification ii-3). nine us academic medical centers participating in the fellows' pelvic research network (fprn). one hundred twenty-seven women with premenopausal breast cancer undergoing oophorectomy between january 2013 and march 2016. surgical castration. the mean patient age was 45.8 years. fourteen patients (11%) carried a brca mutations, and 22 (17%) carried another germline or acquired mutation, including multiple variants of uncertain significance. there was wide variation in surgical approach. sixty-five patients (51%) underwent pelvic washings, and 43 (35%) underwent concurrent hysterectomy. other concomitant procedures included midurethral sling placement, appendectomy, and hysteroscopy. three patients experienced complications (transfusion, wound cellulitis, and vaginal cuff dehiscence). thirteen patients (10%) had ovarian pathology detected on analysis of the surgical specimen, including metastatic tumor, serous cystadenomas, endometriomas, and brenner tumor. eight patients (6%) had fallopian tube pathology, including 3 serous tubal intraepithelial cancers. among the 44 uterine specimens, 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma and 1 multifocal endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia were noted. regarding the entire study population, the number of patients meeting our study criteria and seen by gynecologic surgeons in the fprn for oophorectomy increased by nearly 400% from 2013 to 2015. since publication of the suppression of ovarian function trial data, bilateral oophorectomy has been recommended for some women with premenopausal breast cancer to facilitate breast cancer treatment with aromatase inhibitors. these women may be at elevated risk for occult abdominal pathology compared with the general population. gynecologic surgeons often perform castration oophorectomy in patients with breast cancer as an increasing number of oncologists are using aromatase inhibitors to treat premenopausal breast cancer. our data suggest that other abdominal/pelvic cancers, precancerous conditions, and previously unrecognized metastatic disease are not uncommon findings in this patient population. gynecologists serving this patient population may consider a careful abdominal survey, pelvic washings, endometrial sampling, and serial sectioning of fallopian tube specimens for a thorough evaluation.	-1
genotype: a crucial but not unique factor affecting the clinical phenotypes in fabry disease.  numerous ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a) gene (gla) mutations have been identified in fabry disease (fd), but studies on genotype-phenotype correlation are limited. this study evaluated the features of gla gene mutations and genotype-phenotype relationship in chinese fd patients. gene sequencing results, demographic information, clinical history, and laboratory findings were collected from 73 chinese fd patients. totally 47 mutations were identified, including 23 novel mutations which might be pathogenic. for male patients, those with frameshift and nonsense mutations presented the classical fd, whereas those with missense mutations presented both of classical and atypical phenotypes. interestingly, two male patients with missense mutation p.r356g from two unrelated families, and two with p.r301q from one family presented different phenotypes. a statistically significant association was found between the levels of ?-gal a enzyme activity and ocular changes in males, though no significant association was found between residual enzyme activity level and genotype or clinical phenotypes. for female patients, six out of seven with frameshift mutations and one out of nine with missense mutation presented the classical fd, and ?-gal a activity in those patients was found to be significantly lower than that of patients with atypical phenotypes (13.73 vs. 46.32 nmol/ml/h/mg). our findings suggest that the ?-gal a activity might be associated with the clinical severity in female patients with fd. but no obvious associations between activity level of ?-gal a and genotype or clinical phenotypes were found for male patients.	-1
the point mutation arg615-->cys in the ca2+ release channel of skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum is responsible for hypersensitivity to caffeine and halothane in malignant hyperthermia.  malignant hyperthermia (mh) is an autosomal dominant myopathy. molecular genetic studies have shown that the alteration of arg615 to cys in the ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor) is cosegregated with porcine mh (fujii, j., otsu, k., zorzato, f., de leon, s., khanna, v. k., weiler, j. e., o'brien, p. j., and maclennan, d. h. (1991) science 253, 448-451; otsu, k., khanna, v. k., archibald, a., and maclennan, d. h. (1991) genomics 11, 744-750). here, using the fluorescence calcium indicator indo-1, we determined the concentration of ionized cytosolic calcium in myoblastic cells transfected with either the wild-type or mutated ryanodine receptor cdna. the cells expressing the mutant ryanodine receptor showed higher sensitivity to caffeine, which induces ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor. exposure to clinical doses of halothane resulted in a rapid increase of [ca2+]i in cells expressing the mutated ryanodine receptor, whereas no [ca2+] changes were observed in cells expressing the wild-type ryanodine receptor. these results provide definite evidence that a single amino acid mutation, arg615-->cys, in the ryanodine receptor is causative of mh.	1
the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in the czech republic: spectrum of ldlr mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh), a major risk for coronary heart disease, is predominantly associated with mutations in the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and its ligand apolipoprotein b (apob). in this study, we characterize the spectrum of mutations causing fh in 2239 czech probands suspected to have fh. in this set, we found 265 patients (11.8%) with the apob mutation p.(arg3527gln) and 535 patients (23.9%) with a ldlr mutation. in 535 probands carrying the ldlr mutation, 127 unique allelic variants were detected: 70.1% of these variants were dna substitutions, 16.5% small dna rearrangements, and 13.4% large dna rearrangements. fifty five variants were novel, not described in other fh populations. for lipid profile analyses, fh probands were divided into groups [patients with the ldlr mutation (ldlr+), with the apob mutation (apob+), and without a detected mutation (ldlr-/apob-)], and each group into subgroups according to gender. the statistical analysis of lipid profiles was performed in 1722 probands adjusted for age in which biochemical data were obtained without fh treatment (480 ldlr+ patients, 222 apob+ patients, and 1020 ldlr-/apob- patients). significant gradients in i) total cholesterol (ldlr+ patients > apob+ patients = ldlr-/apob- patients) ii) ldl cholesterol (ldlr+ patients > apob+ patients = ldlr-/apob- patients in men and ldlr+patients > apob+ patients >ldlr-/apob- patients in women), iii) triglycerides (ldlr-/apob- patients > ldlr+ patients > apob+ patients), and iv) hdl cholesterol (apob+ patients > ldlr-/apob- patients = ldlr+ patients) were shown. our study presents a large set of czech patients with fh diagnosis in which dna diagnostics was performed and which allowed statistical analysis of clinical and biochemical data.	-1
high frequency of mutations in mody and mitochondrial genes in scandinavian patients with familial early-onset diabetes.  to investigate the contribution of mutations in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) and mitochondrial genes to early-onset diabetes with a strong family history of diabetes in a cohort with a high prevalence of type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. screening for sequence variants in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)-4alpha (mody1), glucokinase (mody2), hnf-1alpha (mody3) genes and mitochondrial dna was carried out in 115 finnish and swedish patients with early-onset ( </= 40 years) diabetes using the single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) technique and direct sequencing. allele frequencies were compared with 118 patients with onset of diabetes type ii (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus after the age of 40 and 92 non-diabetic control subjects without a family history of diabetes. in total 52 sequence variants were found in the hnf-1alpha, hnf-4alpha and glucokinase genes, 12 of which were considered as mody mutations. three families had the a3243g mutation in the mitochondrial trna(leu) gene, which resulted in an overall prevalence of these mutations of 13 %. among 115 scandinavian families, mutations in the hnf-1alpha gene represented the most common cause of familial early-onset ( </= 40 years) diabetes: mody3 (5.2 %) more than mody2 (3.5 %) more than midd (2.6 %) more than mody1 (1.7 %).	-1
effects of immune modulation therapy in the first croatian infant diagnosed with pompe disease: a 3-year follow-up study.  pompe disease is a storage disorder characterized by deficient or absent activity of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. as a result of ineffective metabolism, glycogen accumulates in muscle tissues. patients with a classic infantile-onset form present by the first few months of life with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and muscle weakness. if left untreated, these patients rapidly die of cardiorespiratory failure. a cross-reactive immunological material (crim)-negative status is predictive of high anti-alglucosidase alpha antibody titers. however, crim-positive patients also sometimes develop robust antibody titers. high antibody titers complicate therapeutic management, and those patients have a worse clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ert).four years ago, we successfully used an immune modulation therapy (imt) protocol in a crim-positive infantile-onset patient with pompe disease in whom ert had to be discontinued because of severe infusion-associated reactions. she was found to be positive for anti-alglucosidase alpha antibodies. imt (rituximab, methotrexate, and intravenous gammaglobulin) was started, and ert was safely reintroduced during the imt induction phase without any complications. antibodies disappeared; imt was tapered and discontinued; and cardiomyopathy steadily improved. during more than 3 years of follow-up, she remained ventilator dependent, and no gains in motor skills were noticed. the antibodies are still undetectable, and no adverse reactions associated with imt had occurred. the cardiomyopathy is gradually increasing, but there is still ~ 50 % reduction as compared with the highest value measured. although the reversal of clinical decline in our crim-positive and antibody-positive infant cannot be solely attributed to imt, this protocol proved itself efficient and safe.	-1
germline and somatic cancer-associated mutations in the atp-binding motifs of pten influence its subcellular localization and tumor suppressive function.  germline and somatic pten mutations are found in cowden syndrome (cs) and multiple sporadic malignancies, respectively. pten function appears to be modulated by subcellular compartmentalization, and mislocalization may affect function. we have shown that cellular atp levels affect nuclear pten levels. here, we examined the atp-binding capabilities of pten and functional consequences, relevant to cancer-associated mutations. pten mutation analysis of cs patients and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and comparative aminoacid analysis were utilized to identify mutations in atp-binding motifs. the ability of wild-type (wt) or mutant pten to bind atp was assessed by atp-agarose-binding assays. subcellular fractionation, western blotting, confocal microscopy and growth assays were used to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization and function. somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived pten missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization. these mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis and anchorage-dependent growth. examination of pten's amino acid sequence revealed these mutations resided in previously undescribed atp-binding motifs (c.60-73; c.122-136). in contrast to wt pten, both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived pten missense mutations, which lie within the atp-binding motifs, result in mutant pten that does not bind atp efficiently. we also show that cs patients with germline atp-binding motif-mutations had nuclear pten mislocalization. of four unrelated patients with functional germline atp-binding domain mutations, all three female patients had breast cancers. germline and somatic mutations within pten's atp-binding domain play important pathogenic roles in both heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by pten nuclear mislocalization resulting in altered signaling and growth. manipulation of atp may represent novel therapies in tumors with such pten alterations.	1
spectrum of mutations in long-qt syndrome genes. kvlqt1, herg, scn5a, kcne1, and kcne2.  long-qt syndrome (lqts) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by prolongation of the qt interval on ecg and presence of syncope, seizures, and sudden death. five genes have been implicated in romano-ward syndrome, the autosomal dominant form of lqts: kvlqt1, herg, scn5a, kcne1, and kcne2. mutations in kvlqt1 and kcne1 also cause the jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome, a form of lqts associated with deafness, a phenotypic abnormality inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. we used mutational analyses to screen a pool of 262 unrelated individuals with lqts for mutations in the 5 defined genes. we identified 134 mutations in addition to the 43 that we previously reported. eighty of the mutations were novel. the total number of mutations in this population is now 177 (68% of individuals). kvlqt1 (42%) and herg (45%) accounted for 87% of identified mutations, and scn5a (8%), kcne1 (3%), and kcne2 (2%) accounted for the other 13%. missense mutations were most common (72%), followed by frameshift mutations (10%), in-frame deletions, and nonsense and splice-site mutations (5% to 7% each). most mutations resided in intracellular (52%) and transmembrane (30%) domains; 12% were found in pore and 6% in extracellular segments. in most cases (78%), a mutation was found in a single family or an individual.	-1
three germline mutations in the tp53 gene.  three germline mutations in the tp53 tumor-suppressor gene are reported, two of which are not reported previously. a missense mutation at codon 265 of tp53 was found in three patients of a family that complied with the definition of the li-fraumeni syndrome. a nonsense mutation in codon 306 was found in a woman who had had a rhabdomyosarcoma at age 4 and a subsequent breast cancer at age 22. she was part of a li-fraumeni-like family, but the parental origin of the mutation could not be traced. finally, while screening for somatic alterations in tp53 in a series of 141 sporadic breast tumors, we detected a constitutional missense mutation in codon 235 in a woman diagnosed with breast cancer at age 26 and a recurrence 4 years later. the recurrence, but not the primary tumor, showed an additional missense mutation at codon 245 as well as loss of the wild-type allele. this suggests that the 245 mutation was particularly important for tumor progression and that there might exist heterogeneity in terms of cancer predisposition potential among the various germline tp53 mutations.	-1
detection of alpha-galactosidase a mutations causing fabry disease by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography.  mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a, gla) gene cause fabry disease, an x-linked recessive lysosomal storage disease. the majority of mutations are private, and confirmation of carrier status in females requires the definitive identification of a dna mutation. in addition, knowledge of a family's mutation enables rapid and precise preimplantation and prenatal genetic testing. here we report the development and use of dhplc to rapidly and cost-effectively screen for alpha-gal a mutations. optimal dhplc partial denaturing conditions for mutation detection were established for each pcr amplicon corresponding to the seven alpha-gal a exons and their adjacent intronic/flanking sequences. at least five known mutations in each exon (45 in total) were screened by dhplc to validate the method. mutation detection was then performed in 14 affected males diagnosed by enzyme assay and 39 at-risk females, and the amplicons with abnormal dhplc profiles were sequenced. in all affected males, and in 32 of the 39 at-risk females, four and 16 previously reported and 10 and 15 new mutations were identified, respectively. sequencing all seven alpha-gal a gene amplicons in the seven at-risk females who had normal dhplc profiles excluded them as mutation carriers. only one mutation (p.p362l) was not initially identified by its dhplc profile, but in retrospect the profile was abnormal, emphasizing the need for experience in inspecting the profiles. in addition, this technique detected two new intronic polymorphisms, c.640-16a>g and c.1000-22c>t, with frequencies of 0.14 and 0.25 in both normal individuals and fabry patients, respectively. this dhplc method should improve the rapidity and cost-effectiveness of alpha-gal a mutation identification in affected males and carrier females for fabry disease.	-1
misdiagnosis of familial mediterranean fever in patients with anderson-fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is an underdiagnosed pathology due to its symptomatology that overlaps with various systemic and rheumatic disorders, including familial mediterranean fever (fmf). we examined the mediterranean fever (mefv) and ?-galactosidase a (gla) genes, whose mutations are responsible for fmf and fd, respectively, in 42 unrelated patients diagnosed with fmf, which revealed significant ambiguity regarding some of the symptoms which are also present in fd. the objective of this study was to determine the spectrum of mutations present in these genes, in order to identify cases of mistaken diagnosis of fmf and/or missed diagnosis of fd. ten out of 42 patients had one mutation in homozygosis or two different mutations in heterozygosis in the mefv gene; 20/42 had a single heterozygous mutation, and 12/42 did not have genetic alterations in mefv. the analysis of the gla gene conducted on all the samples revealed that three subjects, and some members of their families, had two different exonic mutations associated with fd. family studies allowed us to identify eight other cases of fd, bringing the total undiagnosed subjects to 11/53. analyzing the mefv and gla genes in patients with clinical diagnoses of fmf proved to be fundamentally important for the reduction of diagnostic errors.	-1
functionality of sequence variants in the genes coding for the low-density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein b in individuals with inherited hypercholesterolemia.  patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) have elevated ldl-c levels, usually above the 90th percentile (p90) for age and gender. however, large-scale genetic cascade screening for fh showed that 15% of the ldl-receptor (ldlr) or apolipoprotein b (apob) mutation carriers have ldl-c levels below p75. nonpathogenicity of sequence changes may explain this phenomenon. to assess pathogenicity of a mutation we proposed three criteria: (1) mean ldl-c 4p75 in untreated mutation carriers; (2) higher mean ldl-c level in untreated carriers than in untreated noncarriers; and (3) higher percentage of medication users in carriers than in noncarriers at screening. we considered a mutation nonpathogenic when none of the three criteria were met. we applied these criteria to mutations that had been determined in more than 50 untreated adults. segregation analysis was performed to confirm nonpathogenicity. forty-six mutations had been tested in more than 50 untreated subjects, and three were nonpathogenic according to our criteria: one in ldlr (c.108c4a, exon 2) and two in apob (c.13154t4c and c.13181t4c, both in exon 29). segregation analysis also indicated nonpathogenicity. according to our criteria, three sequence variants were nonpathogenic. the criteria may help to identify nonpathogenic sequence changes in genetic cascade screening programs.	-1
loss-of-function of the voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.5 (channelopathies) in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.  scn5a encodes the ?-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel nav1.5. many patients with cardiac arrhythmias caused by mutations in scn5a also have symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). we investigated whether patients with ibs have scn5a variants that affect the function of nav1.5. we performed genotype analysis of scn5a in 584 persons with ibs and 1380 without ibs (controls). mutant forms of scn5a were expressed in human embryonic kidney-293 cells, and functions were assessed by voltage clamp analysis. a genome-wide association study was analyzed for an association signal for the scn5a gene, and replicated in 1745 patients in 4 independent cohorts of ibs patients and controls. missense mutations were found in scn5a in 13 of 584 patients (2.2%, probands). diarrhea-predominant ibs was the most prevalent form of ibs in the overall study population (25%). however, a greater percentage of individuals with scn5a mutations had constipation-predominant ibs (31%) than diarrhea-predominant ibs (10%; p < .05). electrophysiologic analysis showed that 10 of 13 detected mutations disrupted nav1.5 function (9 loss-of-function and 1 gain-of-function function). the p. a997t-nav1.5 had the greatest effect in reducing nav1.5 function. incubation of cells that expressed this variant with mexiletine restored their sodium current and administration of mexiletine to 1 carrier of this mutation (who had constipation-predominant ibs) normalized their bowel habits. in the genome-wide association study and 4 replicated studies, the scn5a locus was strongly associated with ibs. about 2% of patients with ibs carry mutations in scn5a. most of these are loss-of-function mutations that disrupt nav1.5 channel function. these findings provide a new pathogenic mechanism for ibs and possible treatment options.	1
urinary biomarker investigation in children with fabry disease using tandem mass spectrometry.  fabry disease is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting both males and females with tremendous genotypic/phenotypic variability. concentrations of globotriaosylceramide (gb3), globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-gb3)/related analogues were investigated in pediatric and adult fabry cohorts. the aims of this study were to transfer and validate an hplc-ms/ms methodology on a uplc-ms/ms new generation platform, using an hplc column, for urine analysis of treated and untreated pediatric and adult fabry patients, to establish correlations between the excretion of fabry biomarkers with gender, treatment, types of mutations, and to evaluate the biomarker reliability for early detection of pediatric fabry patients. a uplc-ms/ms was used for biomarker analysis. reference values are presented for all biomarkers. results show that gender strongly influences the excretion of each biomarker in the pediatric fabry cohort, with females having lower urinary levels of all biomarkers. urinary distribution of lyso-gb3/related analogues in treated fabry males was similar to the untreated and treated fabry female groups in both children and adult cohorts. children with the late-onset p.n215s mutation had normal urinary levels of gb3, and lyso-gb3 but abnormal levels of related analogues. in this study, fabry males and most fabry females would have been diagnosed using the urinary lyso-gb3/related analogue profile.	-1
prevalence of variant reclassification following hereditary cancer genetic testing.  variant reclassification is an important component of hereditary cancer genetic testing; however, there are few published data quantifying the prevalence of reclassification. retrospective cohort study of individuals who had genetic testing from 2006 through 2016 at a single commercial laboratory. a retrospective cohort of individuals who had genetic testing between 2006 and 2016 at a single commercial laboratory was assessed. variants were classified as benign, likely benign, variant of uncertain significance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. retrospective chart reviews were conducted for patients from the university of texas southwestern (utsw) medical center. hereditary cancer genetic testing. frequency of and time to amended reports; frequency and types of variant reclassification. from 2006 through 2018, 1.45 million individuals (median [interquartile range] age at testing, 49 years [40.69-58.31 years], 95.6% women) had genetic testing, and 56.6% (n = 821 724) had a personal history of cancer. a total of 1.67 million initial tests were reported and 59 955 amended reports were issued due to variant reclassification. overall, 6.4% (2868 of 44 777) of unique variants were reclassified. reclassification to a different clinical category was rare among unique variants initially classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (0.7%, 61 of 9112) or benign or likely benign (0.2%, 15 of 8995). however, 7.7% (2048 of 26 670) of unique variants of uncertain significance were reclassified: 91.2% (1867 of 2048) were downgraded to benign or likely benign (median time to amended report, 1.17 years), 8.7% (178 of 2048) were upgraded to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (median time to amended report, 1.86 years). because most variants were observed in more than 1 individual, 24.9% (46 890 of 184 327) of all reported variants of uncertain significance were reclassified. following hereditary cancer genetic testing at a single commercial laboratory, 24.9% of variants of uncertain significance were reclassified, which included both downgrades and upgrades. further research is needed to assess generalizability of the findings for other laboratories, as well as the clinical consequences of the reclassification as a component of a genetic testing program.	-1
predominance of a 6 bp deletion in exon 2 of the ldl receptor gene in africans with familial hypercholesterolaemia.  in south africa, the high prevalence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) among afrikaners, jews, and indians as a result of founder genes is in striking contrast to its reported virtual absence in the black population in general. in this study, the molecular basis of primary hypercholesterolaemia was studied in 16 africans diagnosed with fh. dna analysis using three screening methods resulted in the identification of seven different mutations in the coding region of the low density lipoprotein (ldlr) gene in 10 of the patients analysed. these included a 6 bp deletion (gcgatg) accounting for 28% of defective alleles, and six point mutations (d151h, r232w, r385q, e387k, p678l, and r793q) detected in single families. the sotho patient with missense mutation r232w was also heterozygous for a de novo splicing defect 313+1g-->a. several silent mutations/polymorphisms were detected in the ldlr and apolipoprotein b genes, including a base change (g-->t) at nucleotide position -175 in the fp2 ldlr regulatory element. this promoter variant was detected at a significantly higher (p<0.05) frequency in fh patients compared to controls and occurred in cis with mutation e387k in one family. analysis of four intragenic ldlr gene polymorphisms showed that the same chromosomal background was identified at this locus in the four fh patients with the 6 bp deletion. detection of the 6 bp deletion in xhosa, pedi, and tswana fh patients suggests that it is an ancient mutation predating tribal separation approximately 3000 years ago.	-1
three patients with glycogen storage disease type ii and the mutational spectrum of gaa in korean patients.  glycogen storage disease ii (gsd ii) is caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase and mutations in the gaa gene encoding this enzyme which are responsible for the pathogenesis of gsd ii. our goal was to determine the mutational spectrum in the gaa gene in korean patients with gsd ii. three patients with gsd ii were recruited based on clinical and biochemical findings. alpha-1,4-glucosidase activity was determined and the gaa gene sequence was analyzed by pcr and sequencing. we also collected information about the genotypes of korean patients with gsd ii from the medical literature. we identified six mutant alleles among the three gsd ii patients: c.875a>g, c.1156c>t, c.1316t>a, c.1857c>g, and c2407_2412del7. c.1156c>t (q386*) is a novel mutation. a comprehensive review of the literature revealed that a total of 29 mutant alleles, including 15 different mutations (10 missense, 3 deletion, and 2 nonsense mutations), were previously identified in 15 korean gsd ii patients. c.1316t>a (p.m439k) and c.1857c>g (p.s619r) were the most common mutations and accounted for 36.6% of the total mutant alleles. we identified three gsd ii patients and investigated the mutational spectrum in gaa in korean patients with gsd ii. our results indicate that common mutations in the gaa gene vary according to ethnic background.	-1
[clinical and molecular genetic study on two patients of the juvenile form of pompe disease in china].  glycogen-storage disease type ii (gsd ii, pompe's disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a functional deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) that leads to glycogen accumulation within lysosomes in most tissues. the gaa gene is located to human chromosome 17q25 and contains 20 exons, 19 of which are coding. clinically, patients with the severe infantile form of gsd ii have muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy eventually leading to death before the age of two years. patients with the juvenile or the adult form of gsd ii present with myopathy with a slow progression over several years or decades. a broad genetic heterogeneity has been described in gsd ii in europe, south africa, usa, japan and korea, however, the investigation has not been performed in the patients from the mainland of china. in this study, clinical analysis and mutation detection were done on chinese patients. two unrelated juvenile patients with late onset gsd ii (one boy, 3 years old and one girl, 9 years old) were included in the study with the informed consents. the diagnosis was confirmed by alpha-glucosidase determination in cultured fibroblasts. in addition, their clinical presentation, laboratory findings, electrophysiologic studies and muscle biopsy findings were analyzed in detail. genomic dna samples were extracted from fibroblasts of the probands, from peripheral blood of their parents and 50 unrelated, normal individuals. all the coding 19 exons and exon-intron boundaries of gaa were detected in the proband by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and direct sequencing. one patient presented decrease of muscle strength, limb-girdle hypotonia, the other patient presented reduced muscle volumes and respiratory problems. both had increased cpk value, myopathic pattern on emg; vacuoles on muscle biopsy, and deficiency of 1, 4-alpha-glucosidase activity. after 1 year follow up, the girl died after pneumonia at 10 years of age. one patient was found to be compound heretozygote for the novel mutation arg702his, and the previously reported mutation pro266ser, which was reported in korean population, with the late-onset phenotype. two novel missense mutations thr711arg, val723met were found on the other patients. three mutations identified in the patient were new missense mutations causing late onset gsd ii, which had not been reported elsewhere before.	-1
"frequency of cdh1 germline mutations in gastric carcinoma coming from high- and low-risk areas: metanalysis and systematic review of the literature.  the frequency of e-cadherin germline mutations in countries with different incidence rates for gastric carcinoma has not been well established. the goal of this study was to assess the worldwide frequency of cdh1 germline mutations in gastric cancers coming from low- and high-risk areas. english articles using medline access (from 1998 to 2011). search terms included cdh1, e-cadherin, germline mutation, gastric cancer, hereditary, familial and diffuse histotype.the study included all e-cadherin germline mutations identified in gastric cancer patients; somatic mutations and germline mutations reported in other tumors were excluded.the method of this study was scheduled in accordance with the ""prisma statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses"". countries were classified as low- or middle/high risk-areas for gastric carcinoma incidence. statistical analysis was performed to correlate the cdh1 mutation frequency with gastric cancer incidence areas. a total of 122 e-cadherin germline mutations have been identified; the majority (87.5%) occurred in gastric cancers coming from low-risk areas. in high-risk areas, we identified 16 mutations in which missense mutations were predominant. (68.8%). we verified a significant association between the mutation frequency and the gastric cancer risk area (p < 0.001: overall identified mutations in low- vs. middle/high-risk areas). e-cadherin genetic screenings performed in low-risk areas for gastric cancer identified a higher frequency of cdh1 germline mutations. this data could open new approaches in the gastric cancer prevention test; before proposing a proband candidate for the cdh1 genetic screening, geographic variability, alongside the family history should be considered."	-1
correlation between genotype and the tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenotype in chinese patients with phenylketonuria.  a growing body of research has suggested that tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsive phenotype can be predicted by the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) genotype in patients with phenylketonuria (pku), but data concerning the association between genotype and bh4 responsiveness are scarce in china. a total of 165 pku patients from china who had undergone a 24-h loading test with bh4 administration were recruited. genotyping was performed by the next-generation sequencing (ngs) technique. using the predicted residual pah activity, we analyzed the association between genotype and bh4-responsiveness. among the 165 patients, 40 patients (24.24%) responded to bh4. a total of 74 distinct mutations were observed, including 13 novel mutations. the mutation p.r241c was most frequently associated with response. two known mutations (p.a322t and p.q419r) and two novel mutations (p.l98v and ivs3-2a>t) were first reported as responsive to bh4. residual pah activity of at least 12.5% was needed for responsive genotypes. genotype-based predictions of bh4-responsiveness are only for selecting potential responders. accordingly, it is necessary to test potential responders with a long-term bh4 challenge.	-1
targeted population screening of late onset pompe disease in unspecified myopathy patients for korean population.  we performed targeted population screening of late onset pompe disease (lopd) in unspecified myopathy patients, because early diagnosis is difficult due to its heterogeneous clinical features. we prospectively enrolled 90 unrelated myopathic patients who had one or more signs out of five lopd-like clinical findings (proximal weakness, axial weakness, lingual weakness, respiratory difficulty, idiopathic hyperckemia). acid alpha glucosidase activity was evaluated with dried blood spot and mixed leukocyte simultaneously. for a final diagnosis of lopd, 16 patients with decreased enzyme activity were genotyped by gaa molecular analysis. we found two patients with lopd (2.2%), and the remaining 14 patients had at least one g576s or e689k mutation, known as the pseudodeficiency allele. acid alpha glucosidase activity of lopd patients was significantly lower than that of patients with at least one pseudodeficiency allele (p = 0.017). this study is the first lopd screening study for targeted korean population, and more generally, an asian population. our findings suggest that for diagnosis of lopd in asian population, modified cutoff value of acid alpha glucosidase activity with dry blood spot considering that of patients having heterozygote pathogenic variants or pseudodeficiency alleles may reduce time and cost requirements and increase the comfort of patients.	-1
cdh23 mutation and phenotype heterogeneity: a profile of 107 diverse families with usher syndrome and nonsyndromic deafness.  usher syndrome type i is characterized by congenital hearing loss, retinitis pigmentosa (rp), and variable vestibular areflexia. usher syndrome type id, one of seven usher syndrome type i genetic localizations, have been mapped to a chromosomal interval that overlaps with a nonsyndromic-deafness localization, dfnb12. mutations in cdh23, a gene that encodes a putative cell-adhesion protein with multiple cadherin-like domains, are responsible for both usher syndrome and dfnb12 nonsyndromic deafness. specific cdh23 mutational defects have been identified that differentiate these two phenotypes. only missense mutations of cdh23 have been observed in families with nonsyndromic deafness, whereas nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and missense mutations have been identified in families with usher syndrome. in the present study, a panel of 69 probands with usher syndrome and 38 probands with recessive nonsyndromic deafness were screened for the presence of mutations in the entire coding region of cdh23, by heteroduplex, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and direct sequence analyses. a total of 36 different cdh23 mutations were detected in 45 families; 33 of these mutations were novel, including 18 missense, 3 nonsense, 5 splicing defects, 5 microdeletions, and 2 insertions. a total of seven mutations were common to more than one family. numerous exonic and intronic polymorphisms also were detected. results of ophthalmologic examinations of the patients with nonsyndromic deafness have found asymptomatic rp-like manifestations, indicating that missense mutations may have a subtle effect in the retina. furthermore, patients with mutations in cdh23 display a wide range of hearing loss and rp phenotypes, differing in severity, age at onset, type, and the presence or absence of vestibular areflexia.	-1
resequencing the whole myh7 gene (including the intronic, promoter, and 3' utr sequences) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  myh7 mutations are found in ~20% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) patients. currently, mutational analysis is based on the sequencing of the coding exons and a few exon-flanking intronic nucleotides, resulting in omission of single-exon deletions and mutations in internal intronic, promoter, and 3' utr regions. we amplified and sequenced large myh7 fragments in 60 hcm patients without previously identified sarcomere mutations. lack of aberrant pcr fragments excluded single-exon deletions in the patients. instead, we identified several new rare intronic variants. an intron 26 single nucleotide insertion (-5 insc) was predicted to affect pre-mrna splicing, but allele frequencies did not differ between patients and controls (n = 150). we found several rare promoter variants in the patients compared to controls, some of which were in binding sites for transcription factors and could thus affect gene expression. only one rare 3' utr variant (c.*29t>c) found in the patients was absent among the controls. this nucleotide change would not affect the binding of known micrornas. therefore, myh7 mutations outside the coding exon sequences would be rarely found among hcm patients. however, changes in the promoter region could be linked to the risk of developing hcm. further research to define the functional effect of these variants on gene expression is necessary to confirm the role of the myh7 promoter in cardiac hypertrophy.	-1
"prevalence of anderson-fabry disease in male patients with late onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  although studies have suggested that ""late-onset"" hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) may be caused by sarcomeric protein gene mutations, the cause of hcm in the majority of patients is unknown. this study determined the prevalence of a potentially treatable cause of hypertrophy, anderson-fabry disease, in a hcm referral population. plasma alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal) was measured in 79 men with hcm who were diagnosed at > or =40 years of age (52.9+/-7.7 years; range, 40-71 years) and in 74 men who were diagnosed at <40 years (25.9+/-9.2 years; range, 8-39 years). five patients (6.3%) with late-onset disease and 1 patient (1.4%) diagnosed at <40 years had low alpha-gal activity. of these 6 patients, 3 had angina, 4 were in new york heart association class 2, 5 had palpitations, and 2 had a history of syncope. hypertrophy was concentric in 5 patients and asymmetric in 1 patient. one patient had left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. all patients with low alpha-gal activity had alpha-gal gene mutations. anderson-fabry disease should be considered in all cases of unexplained hypertrophy. its recognition is important given the advent of specific replacement enzyme therapy."	-1

mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (hnf1a) and 4 alpha (hnf4a) in maturity-onset diabetes of the young.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance, early age of onset (often <25 years of age), and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. mody is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with six different genes identified to date; glucokinase (gck), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha (hnf1a, or tcf1), hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (hnf4a), insulin promoter factor-1 (ipf1 or pdx1), hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 beta (hnf1b or tcf2), and neurogenic differentiation 1 (neurod1). mutations in the hnf1a gene are a common cause of mody in the majority of populations studied. a total of 193 different mutations have been described in 373 families. the most common mutation is pro291fs (p291fsinsc) in the polycytosine (poly c) tract of exon 4, which has been reported in 65 families. hnf4a mutations are rarer; 31 mutations reported in 40 families. sensitivity to treatment with sulfonylurea tablets is a feature of both hnf1a and hnf4a mutations. the identification of an hnf1a or 4a gene mutation confirms a diagnosis of mody and has important implications for clinical management.	-1
pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type ii) in argentineans: clinical manifestations and identification of 9 novel mutations.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in 1,4-alpha-glucosidase (ec.3.2.1.3), the enzyme required to hydrolyze lysosomal glycogen to glucose. while previous studies have focused on pompe patients from europe, the united states, and taiwan, we have analyzed a group of south american pompe patients to better understand the molecular basis of their disease. from 14 argentinean patients diagnosed with either infantile or late-onset disease, we identified 14 distinct mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene including nine novel variants (c.236_246del, c.377g>a, c.1099t>c, c.1397t>g, c.1755-1g>a, c.1802c>g, c.1978c>t, c.2281delginsat, and c.2608c>t). three different families displayed the c.377g>a allelic variant, suggesting a higher frequency among a subset of argentineans. comparison of patients with similar or identical variations in the gaa gene highlights the phenotypic diversity of late-onset disease and supports a role for other genetic and environmental factors in disease presentation.	-1
cdh1 truncating mutations in the e-cadherin gene: an indication for total gastrectomy to treat hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  approximately 1% to 3% of all gastric cancers are associated with families exhibiting an autosomal dominant pattern of susceptibility. e-cadherin (cdh1) truncating mutations have been shown to be present in approximately 30% of families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) and are associated with a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. individuals from a large kindred with hdgc who were identified to have a cdh1 mutation prospectively underwent comprehensive screening with stool occult blood testing, standard upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with random gastric biopsies, high-magnification endoscopy with random gastric biopsies, endoscopic ultrasonography, ct, and pet scans to evaluate the stomach for occult cancer. subsequently, they each underwent total gastrectomy with d-2 node dissection and roux-en-y esophagojejunostomy. the stomach and resected lymph nodes were evaluated pathologically. six patients were identified as cdh1 carriers from a single family. there were 2 men and 4 women. the mean age was 54 years (range, 51-57 years). no patient had any signs or symptoms of gastric cancer. exhaustive preoperative stomach evaluation was normal in each case, and the stomach and adjacent lymph nodes appeared normal at surgery. however, each patient (6 of 6, 100%) was found to have multiple foci of t1 invasive diffuse gastric adenocarcinoma (pure signet-ring cell type). no patient had lymph node or distant metastases. each was staged as t1n0m0. each patient recovered uneventfully without morbidity or mortality. cdh1 mutations in individuals from families with hdgc are associated with gastric cancer in a highly penetrant fashion. cdh1 mutations are an indication for total gastrectomy in these patients. this mutation will identify patients with cancer before other detectable symptoms or signs of the disease.	-1
prevalence of fabry disease in a predominantly hypertensive population with left ventricular hypertrophy.  patients with fabry disease (fd) develop progressive left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). in screening studies in patients with lvh, the prevalence of fd ranges from 0 to 12%. this variability is attributable to different factors like diverging inclusion and exclusion criteria, the evaluation of selected populations and suboptimal screening methods. in this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of fd in an unselected population of everyday clinical practice presenting lvh, defined as a maximal end-diastolic septal or posterior wall thickness ? 13 mm, without exclusion of patients with arterial hypertension or valvular pathology, and using optimal screening methods. in adult males, a two-tier approach was used; ?-galactosidase a (agal a) activity was measured using a dried bloodspot test (dbs) and diagnosis was confirmed by mutation analysis of the gla gene. in females, mutation analysis was the primary screening tool. 362 men and 178 women were screened. six patients were diagnosed with a genetic sequence alteration of the gla gene. one man had a novel mutation, gla p.ala5glu (c.44c>a), presenting as classical fd. another man and three women had the previously described gla p.ala143thr (c.427g>a) mutation, which generally presents as an attenuated phenotype. one woman had a novel sequence alteration c.639+6a>c, which appeared to be a polymorphism. all true fabry patients had arterial hypertension (aht), and one had hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (hocm). in a group of unselected patients with lvh, we found a prevalence of fabry disease of 0.9%. aht or type of hypertrophy should not be an exclusion criterion for screening for fd.	-1
analyses of genetic and clinical parameters for screening patients with inherited thrombocytopenia with small or normal-sized platelets.  childhood thrombocytopenias include immune thrombocytopenic purpura (itp) and inherited thrombocytopenia; the former is caused by autoantibodies to platelets, whereas the latter can be distinguished by platelet size and underlying genetic mutations. due to limited methods for the definite diagnosis of itp, genetic and clinical parameters are required for diagnosing inherited thrombocytopenias with small or normal-sized platelets. in total, 32 japanese patients with thrombocytopenia with small or normal-sized platelets from 29 families were enrolled. all the patients were under 20 years of age, with family histories of early-onset thrombocytopenia and/or poor response to conventional therapies for itp. genotypes and clinical parameters were retrospectively evaluated according to the disease type. twelve cases of inherited thrombocytopenia were observed. we identified chromosomal deletions within the wasp gene in two patients with wiskott-aldrich syndrome; a missense mutation in a patient with x-linked thrombocytopenia; and mutations in the runx1 gene of five patients with familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myelogenous leukemia, and in the ankrd26 gene of four patients with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia-2. all 12 carried germline mutations, three of which were de novo. furthermore, we observed significantly elevated serum thrombopoietin (tpo) levels and dysplasia of megakaryocytes in patients carrying the runx1 and ankrd26 mutations. genetic analyses and detection of tpo levels and dysmegakaryopoiesis were clinically useful for screening patients with inherited thrombocytopenias, irrespective of the family history. we hypothesize that the wasp, runx1, and ankrd26 genes are important for normal tpo signaling and the network underlying thrombopoiesis.	-1
characterization of p53 mutants identified in human tumors with a missense mutation in the tetramerization domain.  p53 is very often mutated in human cancers. the majority of alterations are missense mutations located within the dna-binding domain of the protein. many reports have characterized such mutant proteins. little is known, however, about the properties of proteins that have a missense mutation outside this domain. we investigated here the properties of 8 mutant proteins identified in human tumors as having a missense mutation in the tetramerization domain. the arg342gln, glu349asp and gln354arg proteins behaved like wild-type both in vitro and in cells. two mutants, arg342pro and leu344pro, were inactive in all assays. finally, the 3 mutant proteins leu330his, arg337cys and arg337leu, which are inactive in vitro, showed no activity at low expression levels in cells but became active at higher expression levels. our results reveal new phenotypes for p53 mutants and suggest that sequencing of the p53 gene from patients with tumors should be extended to exons 9 and 10 in clinical investigations.	1
splicing mutations in glycogen-storage disease type ii: evaluation of the full spectrum of mutations and their relation to patients' phenotypes.  glycogen-storage disease type ii is an autosomal recessive-inherited disorder due to the deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase. a large number of mutations in the acid ?-glucosidase gene have been described to date. among them, ~15% are variations that may affect mrna splicing process. in this study, we have for the first time comprehensively reviewed the available information on splicing mutations of the acid ?-glucosidase gene and we have evaluated their possible impact on the splicing process using different in silico approaches. out of the 39 different gaa-sequence variations described, an in silico analysis using seven different programs showed that 97% of them are predicted to have an impact on the splicing process. moreover, this analysis showed a quite good correlation between the impact of the mutation on the splicing process and the clinical phenotype. in addition, we have performed the functional characterization of three novel sequence variants found in italian patients and still uncharacterized. using a minigene system, we have confirmed their pathogenic nature. in conclusion, this study has shown that in silico analysis represents a useful tool to select mutations that affect the splicing process of the acid ?-glucosidase gene and provides an updated picture of all this kind of mutations reported till now.	1
worse prognosis with gene mutations of beta-myosin heavy chain than myosin-binding protein c in chinese patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  no data are available on survival analysis and longitudinal evolution of patients with gene mutations of beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7) and myosin binding protein c (mybpc3) in chinese. to prospectively investigate whether different gene mutations confer distinct prognosis. we performed a prospective study in 70 hcm patients and 46 genetically affected family members without hcm-phenotype with direct dna sequencing of myh7 and mybpc3, clinical assessments, and 5.8 +/- 1.8 years follow-up. after follow-up, more surgical intervention (8/52 versus 0/18, p < 0.001), higher sudden death risk (7/52 versus 0/18, p < 0.001) and shorter life span were found in patients with myh7 mutations than in patients with mybpc3 mutations (45.1 +/- 14.0 versus 73.5 +/- 7.5 years, p = 0.03). seven of the 27 mutation carriers of myh7 had clinical presentations of hcm, but no carriers of mybpc3 mutations developed to hcm during follow-up. maximal wall thickness was thicker in the patients carrying mutations in the global region of myh7 than in those carrying mutations in the rod region of myh7 (21.5 +/- 6.6 versus 15 +/- 6.1 mm, p < 0.05) at baseline. more sudden death (7/41 versus 0/11) and left ventricular dysfunction (nyha class iii approximately iv, 17/32 versus 1/10) were identified in patients with mutations in the global region of myh7 than in patients with other mutations. myh7 mutations, especially in the global region, cause malignant clinical phenotypes.	-1
extreme cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta levels identify family with late-onset alzheimer's disease presenilin 1 mutation.  aggregation and deposition of amyloid beta (abeta) in the brain is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of alzheimer's disease (ad). recent studies suggest that cerebrospinal fluid (csf) abeta levels are strongly correlated with ad status and progression, and may be a meaningful endophenotype for ad. mutations in presenilin 1 (psen1) are known to cause ad and change abeta levels. in this study, we have investigated dna sequence variation in the presenilin (psen1) gene using csf abeta levels as an endophenotype for ad. we sequenced the exons and flanking intronic regions of psen1 in clinically characterized research subjects with extreme values of csf abeta levels. this novel approach led directly to the identification of a disease-causing mutation in a family with late-onset ad. this finding suggests that csf abeta may be a useful endophenotype for genetic studies of ad. our results also suggest that psen1 mutations can cause ad with a large range in age of onset, spanning both early- and late-onset ad.	-1
dna sequence analysis of gjb2, encoding connexin 26: observations from a population of hearing impaired cases and variable carrier rates, complex genotypes, and ethnic stratification of alleles among controls.  mutations in gjb2 are associated with hereditary hearing loss. dna sequencing of gjb2 in a cohort of hearing impaired patients and a multi-ethnic control group is reported. among 610 hearing impaired cases, 43 dna sequence variations were identified in the coding region of gjb2 including 24 mutations, 8 polymorphisms, 3 unclassified variants (g4d, r127c, m163v), 1 controversial variant (v37i), and 7 novel variants (g12c, n14d, v63a, t86m, l132v, d159, 592_600delinscagtgttcatgacattc). sixteen non-coding sequence variations were also identified among cases including the ivs1+1a>g mutation, 2 polymorphisms, and 13 novel variants. a diagnosis of gjb2-associated hearing loss was confirmed for 63 cases (10.3%). heterozygous mutations were found in 39 cases (6.4%). eleven cases carrying novel or unclassified variants (1.8 %) and 18 cases carrying the controversial v37i variant were identified (3%). in addition, 294 control subjects from 4 ethnic groups were sequenced for gjb2. thirteen sequence variations in the coding region of gjb2 were identified among controls including 2 mutations, 6 polymorphisms, 2 unclassified variants (g4d, t123n), 1 controversial variant (v37i), and 2 novel variants (r127l, v207l). nine sequence variations were identified among controls in the non-coding regions in and around gjb2 exon 2. of particular interest among controls were the variability in carrier rates and ethnic stratification of alleles, and the complex genotypes among asians, 47% of whom carried two to four sequence variations in the coding region of gjb2. these data provide new information about carrier rates for gjb2-based hearing loss in various ethnic groups and contribute to evaluation of the pathogenicity of the controversial v37i variant.	-1
illegitimate transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in lymphocytes for identification of mutations in phenylketonuria.  taking advantage of the 'illegitimate' transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene, we have been able to analyse the pah cdna sequence of hyperphenylalaninemic children in circulating lymphocytes. using this approach, we have also identified 3 novel mutations in cdna from liver and lymphocytes of two patients. one mutation, detected by the abnormal pattern of migration of an amplified fragment, is a c to t transition in the splice acceptor site of intron 10, which resulted in the skipping of exon 11 with the premature termination of rna translation downstream from exon 12 (-3 ivs10). the other two mutations are missense mutations in exons 10 and 11 (respectively, l333f and e390g). the present study supports the view that circulating lymphocytes give easy access to pah gene transcripts whose nucleotide sequence is identical to that reported in liver and therefore represent a useful tool for molecular genetic studies in phenylketonuria.	1
hboc multi-gene panel testing: comparison of two sequencing centers.  multi-gene panels are used to identify genetic causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (hboc) in large patient cohorts. this study compares the diagnostic workflow in two centers and gives valuable insights into different next-generation sequencing (ngs) strategies. moreover, we present data from 620 patients sequenced at both centers. both sequencing centers are part of the german consortium for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (gc-hboc). all 620 patients included in this study were selected following standard brca1/2 testing guidelines. a set of 10 sequenced genes was analyzed per patient. twelve samples were exchanged and sequenced at both centers. ngs results were highly concordant in 12 exchanged samples (205/206 variants = 99.51 %). one non-pathogenic variant was missed at center b due to a sequencing gap (no technical coverage). the custom enrichment at center b was optimized during this study; for example, the average number of missing bases was reduced by a factor of four (vers. 1: 1939.41, vers. 4: 506.01 bp). there were no sequencing gaps at center a, but four ccds exons were not included in the enrichment. pathogenic mutations were found in 12.10 % (75/620) of all patients: 4.84 % (30/620) in brca1, 4.35 % in brca2 (27/620), 0.97 % in chek2 (6/620), 0.65 % in atm (4/620), 0.48 % in cdh1 (3/620), 0.32 % in palb2 (2/620), 0.32 % in nbn (2/620), and 0.16 % in tp53 (1/620). ngs diagnostics for hboc-related genes is robust, cost effective, and the method of choice for genetic testing in large cohorts. adding 8 genes to standard brca1- and brca2-testing increased the mutation detection rate by one-third.	-1
enzyme replacement therapy in late-onset pompe's disease: a three-year follow-up.  pompe's disease is an autosomal recessive myopathy. the characteristic lysosomal storage of glycogen is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. patients with late-onset pompe's disease present with progressive muscle weakness also affecting pulmonary function. in search of a treatment, we investigated the feasibility of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from rabbit milk. three patients (aged 11, 16, and 32 years) were enrolled in the study. they were all wheelchair-bound and two of them were ventilator dependent with a history of deteriorating pulmonary function. after 3 years of treatment with weekly infusions of alpha-glucosidase, the patients had stabilized pulmonary function and reported less fatigue. the youngest and least affected patient showed an impressive improvement of skeletal muscle strength and function. after 72 weeks of treatment, he could walk without support and finally abandoned his wheelchair. our findings demonstrate that recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from rabbit milk has a therapeutic effect in late-onset pompe's disease. there is good reason to continue the development of enzyme replacement therapy for pompe's disease and to explore further the production of human therapeutic proteins in the milk of mammals.	-1
palb2 sequencing in italian familial breast cancer cases reveals a high-risk mutation recurrent in the province of bergamo.  monoallelic germ-line deleterious mutations of palb2 (partner and localizer of brca2) are associated with breast cancer risk and have been found in several populations, with carrier frequencies of ~1-2%. initially, these mutations were considered to have moderate penetrance, but accumulating evidence now indicates that they are associated with much higher risk. in this study, we sequenced the palb2 coding regions unlinked to brca (breast cancer) genes in 575 probands from italian breast cancer families recruited in milan. we found 12 carriers (2.1%) of deleterious mutations, and none of the mutations was found in 784 controls collected in milan. one of these mutations, the c.1027c>t (p.gln343x), was found to be recurrent in the province of bergamo in northern italy, being detected in 6/113 (5.3%) familial breast cancer cases and 2/477 (0.4%) controls recruited in this area (fisher's exact test: p < 0.01). our data provide confirmatory findings that, in the italian population also, deleterious mutations of palb2 are relatively frequent predisposing factors for breast cancer and may be associated with high risk of the disease.	1
identification of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)-1 alpha gene in japanese subjects with iddm.  one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young, mody3, is characterized by a severe insulin secretory defect, compared with mody2, a glucokinase-deficient diabetes. it has recently been shown that mutations of the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)-1 alpha cause mody3. because of the rapid progress to overt diabetes and the high prevalence of required insulin treatment in patients with mody3, we screened the hnf-1 alpha gene for mutations in japanese subjects with iddm. ten exons and flanking introns of the hnf-1 alpha gene in these subjects were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing of the products. mutations were identified in three (5.5%) of the 55 unrelated subjects with iddm. a missense mutation of r272h (replacement of arg by his in codon 272) in the dna binding domain of hnf-1 alpha was found in a subject who developed iddm 1 year after diagnosis of niddm at 8 years of age. a frameshift mutation of p291 fsinsc (insertion of a c in a polyc tract around codon 291 for pro), which would generate a mutant truncated protein of 340 amino acids, was found in a subject who started insulin treatment when hyperglycemia and ketonuria were noticed at 13 years of age. a missense mutation of r583g (replacement of arg by gly in codon 583) in the transactivation domain of hnf-1 alpha was found in a subject with sudden-onset iddm at 20 years of age. none of these mutations were present in 100 nondiabetic subjects (200 normal chromosomes). these results indicate that the hnf-1 alpha gene defects could lead to the development of not only early-onset niddm but also iddm, implicating the importance of subclassification of hnf-1 alpha-deficient iddm from a classical type of autoimmune-based iddm in japanese.	-1
germline mutations in cdh1 are infrequent in women with early-onset or familial lobular breast cancers.  germline mutations in cdh1 are associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer; lobular breast cancer also occurs excessively in families with such condition. to determine if cdh1 is a susceptibility gene for lobular breast cancer in women without a family history of diffuse gastric cancer, germline dna was analysed for the presence of cdh1 mutations in 318 women with lobular breast cancer who were diagnosed before the age of 45 years or had a family history of breast cancer and were not known, or known not, to be carriers of germline mutations in brca1 or brca2. cases were ascertained through breast cancer registries and high-risk cancer genetic clinics (breast cancer family registry, the kconfab and a consortium of breast cancer genetics clinics in the united states and spain). additionally, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was performed for 134 cases to detect large deletions. no truncating mutations and no large deletions were detected. six non-synonymous variants were found in seven families. four (4/318 or 1.3%) are considered to be potentially pathogenic through in vitro and in silico analysis. potentially pathogenic germline cdh1 mutations in women with early-onset or familial lobular breast cancer are at most infrequent.	1
molecular genetics of familial hypercholesterolemia in israel.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a multitude of low density lipoprotein receptor (ldl-r) mutations. the purpose of the current investigation was to define the spectrum of mutations causing fh in israel and determine their relative distribution among diverse origin groups. a total of 193 fh families were recruited in israel, 54 of them through the med ped (make early diagnosis prevent early death) fh program. molecular analysis of the ldl-r using single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) or both has been completed in 95 index cases. this analysis resulted in the identification of 15 ldl receptor mutations, including 7 novel mutations (del 197, c308g, r385w, splice junction mutation of intron 14, del 328, del 502-505, stop 10, del 165), that were present in 49 index cases (52%). the 15 mutations are mapped to three known functional domains of the receptor (7 in the ldl-binding region, 7 in the epidermal growth factor precursor homology region and 1 in the membrane-spanning region). screening for the identified mutations in the remaining 98 index cases enabled the molecular diagnosis of 31 additional cases. it is therefore concluded that 80 out of 193 index cases (41%) harbor 1 of the 15 mutations described here. three mutations-del197 (fh-lithuania), d147h (fh-sephardic), and stop660 (lebanese allele)-were found in a total of 66 index cases (34%); these may be regarded as founder mutations in the three respective origin groups. in conclusion, in israel molecular heterogeneity at the ldl receptor gene locus reflects the ethnic distribution of its origin groups. the results of the present investigation provide valuable diagnostic tools for a subset of the israeli patients with fh who are at high risk for atherosclerosis and its complications.	-1
enhanced human brain associative plasticity in costello syndrome.  costello syndrome (cs) is a rare multiple congenital anomaly disorder which is caused by germline mutations in the v-ha-ras harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (hras) proto-oncogene. experimental data suggest perturbing effects of the mutated protein on the functional and structural organization of networks of cerebral cortex and on the activity-dependent strengthening of synaptic transmission known as long term potentiation (ltp). in five patients with molecularly proven diagnosis of cs and in a group of 13 age-matched control subjects we investigated activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. to this end, we used a paired associative stimulation (pas) protocol, in which left ulnar nerve stimuli were followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms) pulses to right cortical hand area, and recorded motor evoked potentials (meps) by single pulse tms from left first dorsal interosseus (fdi) muscle before and after pas. in 4 out of 5 cs patients and in a subgroup of nine control subjects we also evaluated the time course and the topographical specificity of pas after-effects. in these two subgroups, meps were measured before, immediately after and 30 min after pas in the left fdi and left abductor pollicis brevis (apb). while the pas protocol led to a 65% increase of the fdi mep amplitude in controls, the ltp-like phenomenon was significantly more pronounced in cs patients, with motor responses increased by 230%. in addition, cs patients showed a similar mep increase in both muscles while control subjects showed a slight increase in apb and only immediately after pas. we hypothesize that the extremely enhanced pas after-effects could be due to the influence of hras activity on the susceptibility of synapses to undergo ltp.	-1
molecular study on the infantile form of pompe disease in chinese in taiwan.  glycogen-storage disease type ii, pompe disease, is caused by the deficiency of acid alpha-d-glucosidase in lysosome. previously we found that acid alpha-d-glucosidase did exist in the skin fibroblasts and there was also no difference of mrna in quantity and size of chinese infantile type pompe disease patients in taiwan. however, functional assay of the acid alpha-d-glucosidase of these patients showed its enzyme function to be defective. in the present study, first we identified a substitution site in four chinese infantile patients with pompe disease which is a cytidine to adenosine (c1935-->a) transversion at 5' end of exon 14 causing substitution of glutamic acid for aspartic acid at position 645 of the acid alpha-d-glucosidase. this substitution was introduced in wild-type cdna and expressed in cos-1 cells. the asp-645-->glu substitution resulted in significant reduction of acid alpha-d-glucosidase activity. second, according to the screening data in 25 chinese pompe disease patients using digestion of rt-pcr amplified specific fragment with aat ii, the restriction fragment length analysis showed that patients presented the 861 bp band and the normal individuals presented the 728 bp and 133 bp polymorphic bands. we found that the frequency of mutant allele is 0.8 in infantile patients with chinese pompe disease and 0 in normal individuals. these results therefore indicate that asp-645-->glu mutation results in infantile form of pompe disease as the major cause in chinese patients in taiwan.	1
the identification of two low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations in south african familial hypercholesterolaemia.  two point mutations were discovered in the low-density lipoprotein genes of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh). defective genes were cloned and/or amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method and the dna sequences determined. a guanine to adenine base transition in exon 4 was found to be the molecular defect in 20% of cases of fh in the afrikaner population. a second mutation, a guanine to adenine base substitution in exon 9, was identified in two homozygous fh individuals. restriction enzyme analysis of pcr-amplified dna from blood and tissue samples now permits accurate diagnosis of these mutations.	-1
update of the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in the netherlands.  autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemia (adh) has been identified as a major risk factor for coronary vascular disease (cvd) and is associated with mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and the apolipoprotein b (apob) gene. since 1991 dna samples from clinically diagnosed adh patients have been routinely analyzed for the presence of ldlr and apob gene mutations. as of 2001, 1,641 index patients (164 index patients per year) had been identified, while from 2001 onward a more sensitive, high-throughput system was used, resulting in the identification of 1,177 new index patients (average=294 index patients per year). of these 1,177 index cases, 131 different causative genetic variants in the ldlr gene and six different causative mutations in the apob gene were new for the dutch population. of these 131 mutations, 83 ldlr and four apob gene mutations had not been reported before. the inclusion of all 2,818 index cases into the national screening program for familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) resulted in the identification of 7,079 relatives who carried a mutation that causes adh. screening of the ldlr and apob genes in clinically diagnosed fh patients resulted in approximately 77% of the patients being identified as carriers of a causative mutation. the population of patients with adh was divided into three genetically distinct groups: carriers of an ldlr mutation (fh), carriers of an apob mutation (fdb), and non-ldlr/non-apob patients (fh3). no differences were found with regard to untreated cholesterol levels, response to therapy, and onset of cvd. however, all groups were at an increased risk for cvd. therefore, to ultimately identify all individuals with adh, the identification of new genes and mutations in the genes that cause adh is of crucial importance for the ongoing national program to identify patients with adh by genetic cascade screening.	-1
e-cadherin is a tumour/invasion suppressor gene mutated in human lobular breast cancers.  compelling experimental evidence exists for a potent invasion suppressor role of the cell-cell adhesion molecule e-cadherin. in addition, a tumour suppressor effect has been suggested for e-cadherin. in human cancers, partial or complete loss of e-cadherin expression correlates with malignancy. to investigate the molecular basis for this altered expression we developed a comprehensive pcr/sscp mutation screen for the human e-cadherin gene. for 49 breast cancer patients the occurrence of tumour-specific mutations in the e-cadherin gene was examined. no relevant dna changes were encountered in any of 42 infiltrative ductal or medullary breast carcinoma samples. in contrast, four out of seven infiltrative lobular breast carcinomas harboured protein truncation mutations (three nonsense and one frameshift) in the extracellular part of the e-cadherin protein. each of the four lobular carcinomas with e-cadherin mutations showed tumour-specific loss of heterozygosity of chromosomal region 16q22.1 containing the e-cadherin locus. in compliance with this, no e-cadherin expression was detectable by immunohistochemistry in these four tumours. these findings offer a molecular explanation for the typical scattered tumour cell growth in infiltrative lobular breast cancer.	-1
founder and recurrent cdh1 mutations in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is caused by germline mutations in the epithelial cadherin (cdh1) gene and is characterized by an increased risk for diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. to determine whether recurring germline cdh1 mutations occurred due to independent mutational events or common ancestry. thirty-eight families diagnosed clinically with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer were accrued between november 2004 and january 2006 and were analyzed for cdh1 mutations as part of an ongoing study at the british columbia cancer agency. twenty-six families had at least 2 gastric cancer cases with 1 case of diffuse gastric cancer in a person younger than 50 years; 12 families had either a single case of diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in a person younger than 35 years or multiple cases of diffuse gastric cancer diagnosed in persons older than 50 years. classification of family members as carriers or noncarriers of cdh1 mutations. haplotype analysis to assess recurring mutations for common ancestry was performed on 7 families from this study and 7 previously reported families with the same mutations. thirteen mutations (6 novel) were identified in 15 of the 38 families (40% detection rate). the 1137g>a splicing mutation and the 1901c>t (a634v) missense/splicing mutation occurred on common haplotypes in 2 families but on different haplotypes in a third family. the 2195g>a (r732q) missense/splicing mutation occurred in 2 families on different haplotypes. the 2064-2065deltg mutation occurred on a common haplotype in 2 families. two families from this study plus 2 additional families carrying the novel 2398delc mutation shared a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. all 4 families originate from the southeast coast of newfoundland. due to concentrations of lobular breast cancer cases, 2 branches of this family had been diagnosed as having hereditary breast cancer and were tested for brca mutations. within these 4 families, the cumulative risk by age 75 years in mutation carriers for clinically detected gastric cancer was 40% (95% confidence interval [ci], 12%-91%) for males and 63% (95% ci, 19%-99%) for females and the risk for breast cancer in female mutation carriers was 52% (95% ci, 29%-94%). recurrent cdh1 mutations in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer are due to both independent mutational events and common ancestry. the presence of a founder mutation from newfoundland is strongly supported.	1
a mutant form of pten linked to autism.  the tumor suppressor, phosphatase, and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (pten), is a phosphoinositide (pi) phosphatase specific for the 3-position of the inositol ring. pten has been implicated in autism for a subset of patients with macrocephaly. various studies identified patients in this subclass with one normal and one mutated pten gene. we characterize the binding, structural properties, activity, and subcellular localization of one of these autism-related mutants, h93r pten. even though this mutation is located at the phosphatase active site, we find that it affects the functions of neighboring domains. h93r pten binding to phosphatidylserine-bearing model membranes is 5.6-fold enhanced in comparison to wild-type pten. in contrast, we find that binding to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (pi(4,5)p(2)) model membranes is 2.5-fold decreased for the mutant pten in comparison to wild-type pten. the structural change previously found for wild-type pten upon interaction with pi(4,5)p(2), is absent for h93r pten. consistent with the increased binding to phosphatidylserine, we find enhanced plasma membrane association of pten-gfp in u87mg cells. however, this enhanced plasma membrane association does not translate into increased pi(3,4,5)p(3) turnover, since in vivo studies show a reduced activity of the h93r pten-gfp mutant. because the interaction of pi(4,5)p(2) with pten's n-terminal domain is diminished by this mutation, we hypothesize that the interaction of pten's n-terminal domain with the phosphatase domain is impacted by the h93r mutation, preventing pi(4,5)p(2) from inducing the conformational change that activates phosphatase activity.	1
neonatal screening for lysosomal storage disorders: feasibility and incidence from a nationwide study in austria.  the interest in neonatal screening for lysosomal storage disorders has increased substantially because of newly developed enzyme replacement therapies, the need for early diagnosis, and technical advances. we tested for gaucher's disease, pompe's disease, fabry's disease, and niemann-pick disease types a and b in an anonymous prospective nationwide screening study that included genetic mutation analysis to assess the practicality and appropriateness of including these disorders in neonatal screening panels. specimens from dried blood spots of 34,736 newborn babies were collected consecutively from january, 2010 to july, 2010, as part of the national routine austrian newborn screening programme. anonymised samples were analysed for enzyme activities of acid ?-glucocerebrosidase, ?-galactosidase, ?-glucosidase, and acid sphingomyelinase by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. genetic mutation analyses were done in samples with suspected enzyme deficiency. all 34,736 samples were analysed successfully by the multiplex screening assay. low enzyme activities were detected in 38 babies. mutation analysis confirmed lysosomal storage disorders in 15 of them. the most frequent mutations were found for fabry's disease (1 per 3859 births), followed by pompe's disease (1 per 8684), and gaucher's disease (1 per 17,368). the positive predictive values were 32% (95% ci 16-52), 80% (28-99), and 50% (7-93), respectively. mutational analysis detected predominantly missense mutations associated with a late-onset phenotype. the combined overall proportion of infants carrying a mutation for lysosomal storage disorders was higher than expected. neonatal screening for lysosomal storage disorders is likely to raise challenges for primary health-care providers. furthermore, the high frequency of late-onset mutations makes lysosomal storage disorders a broad health problem beyond childhood. austrian ministry of health, family, and women.	-1
organization and sequence of human cardiac myosin binding protein c gene (mybpc3) and identification of mutations predicted to produce truncated proteins in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  cardiac myosin binding protein c (mybp-c) is a sarcomeric protein belonging to the intracellular immunoglobulin superfamily. its function is uncertain, but for a decade evidence has existed for both structural and regulatory roles. the gene encoding cardiac mybp-c (mybpc3) in humans is located on chromosome 11p11.2, and mutations have been identified in this gene in unrelated families with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc). detailed characterization of the mybpc3 gene is essential for studies on gene regulation, analysis of the role of mybp-c in cardiac contraction through the use of recombinant dna technology, and mutational analyses of fhc. the organization of human mybpc3 and screening for mutations in a panel of french families with fhc were established using polymerase chain reaction, single-strand conformation polymorphism, and sequencing. the mybpc3 gene comprises > 21,000 base pairs and contains 35 exons. two exons are unusually small in size, 3 bp each. we found six new mutations associated with fhc in seven unrelated french families. four of these mutations are predicted to produce truncated cardiac mybp-c polypeptides. the two others should each produce two aberrant proteins, one truncated and one mutated. the present study provides the first organization and sequence for an mybp-c gene. the mutations reported here and previously in mybpc3 result in aberrant transcripts that are predicted to encode significantly truncated cardiac mybp-c polypeptides. this spectrum of mutations differs from the ones previously observed in other disease genes causing fhc. our data strengthen the functional importance of mybp-c in the regulation of cardiac work and provide the basis for further studies.	1
dominant-negative alk2 allele associates with congenital heart defects.  serious congenital heart defects occur as a result of improper atrioventricular septum (avs) development during embryogenesis. despite extensive knowledge of the genetic control of avs development, few genetic lesions have been identified that are responsible for avs-associated congenital heart defects. we sequenced 32 genes known to be important in avs development in patients with avs defects and identified 11 novel coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms that are predicted to impair protein function. we focused on variants identified in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor, alk2, and subjected 2 identified variants to functional analysis. the coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms r307l and l343p are heterozygous missense substitutions and were each identified in single individuals. the l343p allele had impaired functional activity as measured by in vitro kinase and bone morphogenetic protein-specific transcriptional response assays and dominant-interfering activity in vivo. in vivo analysis of zebrafish embryos injected with alk2 l343p rna revealed improper atrioventricular canal formation. these data identify the dominant-negative allele alk2 l343p in a patient with avs defects.	-1
the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxynojirimycin increases the activity and lysosomal trafficking of multiple mutant forms of acid alpha-glucosidase.  pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder (lsd) caused by mutations in the gene that encodes acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). recently, small molecule pharmacological chaperones have been shown to increase protein stability and cellular levels for mutant lysosomal enzymes and have emerged as a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lsds. in this study, we characterized the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxynojirimycin (dnj) on 76 different mutant forms of gaa identified in pompe disease. dnj significantly increased enzyme activity and protein levels for 16 different gaa mutants in patient-derived fibroblasts and in transiently transfected cos-7 cells. additionally, dnj increased the processing of these gaa mutants to their mature lysosomal forms, suggesting facilitated trafficking through the secretory pathway. immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed increased colocalization of gaa with the lysosomal marker lamp2 after incubation with dnj, confirming increased lysosomal trafficking. lastly, a gaa structural model was constructed based on the related eukaryotic glucosidase maltase-glucoamylase. the mutated residues identified in responsive forms of gaa are located throughout most of the structural domains, with half of these residues located in two short regions within the catalytic domain. taken together, these data support further evaluation of dnj as a potential treatment for pompe disease in patients that express responsive forms of gaa.	1
molecular characterization of familial hypercholesterolemia in spain: identification of 39 novel and 77 recurrent mutations in ldlr.  mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene cause familial hypercholesterolemia (fh), an autosomal dominant inherited disorder associated with an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis. the aim of this study was to characterize the ldlr mutations in a group of 476 apparently non-related spanish fh patients. the promoter region and the 18 exons with their flanking intron sequences of the ldlr gene were screened by pcr-sscp analysis and dna sequencing. in addition, we tested for the presence of the mutation p.r3500q in the gene coding for apolipoprotein b-100 (apo b-100). we found 77 mutations previously described, and 39 novel mutations affecting the ldlr gene: 8 missense, 5 nonsense, 15 frameshift, 5 splicing, 4 in frame, one nucleotide change in the non-coding sequence of exon 1, and one silent variant. we have identified al least one of these ldlr gene mutations in 329 subjects (69%). four patients were homozygous, 4 patients were compound heterozygous, 48 patients were found to carry two different sequence variants in the same allele and 4 patients carried three different sequence variants in the same allele. additionally, 4 subjects were carriers of the p.r3500q mutation in the apo b gene. all of these findings indicate that there is a broad spectrum of mutations and sequence variants in the ldlr gene causing fh in spain.	-1
molecular characterisation of phenylketonuria in a chinese mainland population using next-generation sequencing.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder of phenylalanine metabolism, mainly caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). the incidence of various pah mutations differs among race and ethnicity. here we report a spectrum of pah mutations complied from 796 pku patients from mainland china. the all 13 exons and adjacent intronic regions of the pah gene were determined by next-generation sequencing. we identified 194 different mutations, of which 41 are not reported before. several mutations reoccurred with high frequency including p.r243q, p.ex6-96a > g, p.v399v, p.r241c, p.r111*, p.y356*, p.r413p, and ivs4-1g > a. 76.33% of mutations were localized in exons 3, 6, 7, 11, 12. we further compared the frequency of each mutation between populations in northern and southern china, and found significant differences in 19 mutations. furthermore, we identified 101 mutations that are not reported before in chinese population, our study thus broadens the mutational spectrum of chinese pku patients. additionally, 41 novel mutations will expand and improve pah mutation database. finally, our study offers proof that ngs is effective, reduces screening times and costs, and facilitates the provision of appropriate genetic counseling for pku patients.	-1
structure of human lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase-a guide for the treatment of pompe disease.  pompe disease, a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase (gaa), is characterized by glycogen accumulation, triggering severe secondary cellular damage and resulting in progressive motor handicap and premature death. numerous disease-causing mutations in the gaa gene have been reported, but the structural effects of the pathological variants were unknown. here we present the high-resolution crystal structures of recombinant human gaa (rhgaa), the standard care of pompe disease. these structures portray the unbound form of rhgaa and complexes thereof with active site-directed inhibitors, providing insight into substrate recognition and the molecular framework for the rationalization of the deleterious effects of disease-causing mutations. furthermore, we report the structure of rhgaa in complex with the allosteric pharmacological chaperone n-acetylcysteine, which reveals the stabilizing function of this chaperone at the structural level.	1
association of exome sequences with cardiovascular traits among blacks in the jackson heart study.  the correlation of null alleles with human phenotypes can provide insight into gene function in humans. in individuals of african ancestry, we set out to identify null and damaging missense variants, and test these variants for association with a range of cardiovascular phenotypes. we performed whole-exome sequencing in 3223 black individuals from the jackson heart study and found a total of 729 666 variant sites with minor allele frequency <5%, including 17 263 null variants and 49 929 missense variants predicted to be damaging by in silico algorithms. we tested null and damaging missense variants within each gene for association with 36 cardiovascular traits. we found 3 associations that met our prespecified level of significance (?=1.110(-7)). null and damaging missense variants in pcsk9 were associated with 36 mg/dl lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=310(-21)). three individuals in their 50s with complete pcsk9 deficiency (each compound heterozygote for pcsk9 p.y142x and p.c679x) were identified, with one having a coronary artery calcification score in the 83rd percentile despite a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 32 mg/dl. a damaging missense variant in hbq1 (p.g52a) was associated with a 2 pg/cell lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin (p=910(-13)) and rare damaging missense variants in vps13a with higher red blood cell distribution width (p=9.910(-8)). a limited number of null/damaging alleles with a large effect on cardiovascular traits were detectable in ?3000 black individuals.	-1
single-strand conformation polymorphism for detection of mutations and base substitutions in phenylketonuria.  in the past few years, more than 20 different mutations have been reported in hyperphenylalaninemias. in southwestern europe and mediterranean countries, however, the mutant genotypes reported account for only a fraction (27%) of all mutant alleles at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus, and most of the mutations causing the disease remain unknown. in order to develop a strategy for rapid detection of mutation-containing exons, we applied the single-strand conformation-polymorphism (sscp) technique to exons 3, 5, 7, and 12 of the pah gene. we observed five abnormal patterns of migration in mutant pah genes, and we consistently found base substitutions in the corresponding exons, with no false-positive results. by this procedure, two novel putative mutations were detected in the seventh exon of the pah gene, (a259v and y277d) and we were able to demonstrate that the delta i94, r158q, r408w, and e280k mutations were easily detectable by the sscp technique. this procedure is therefore of particular interest for rapid detection of mutation-containing exons and for determination of further genotype-phenotype correlations in hyperphenylalaninemias.	-1
the use of next-generation sequencing in clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia is a common mendelian disorder associated with early-onset coronary heart disease that can be treated by cholesterol-lowering drugs. the majority of cases in the united kingdom are currently without a molecular diagnosis, which is partly due to the cost and time associated with standard screening techniques. the main purpose of this study was to test the sensitivity and specificity of two next-generation sequencing protocols for genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. libraries were prepared for next-generation sequencing by two target enrichment protocols; one using the sureselect target enrichment system and the other using the pcr-based access array platform. in the validation cohort, both protocols showed 100% specificity, whereas the sensitivity for short variant detection was 100% for the sureselect target enrichment and 98% for the access array protocol. large deletions/duplications were only detected using the sureselect target enrichment protocol. in the prospective cohort, the mutation detection rate using the access array was highest in patients with clinically definite familial hypercholesterolemia (67%), followed by patients with possible familial hypercholesterolemia (26%). we have shown the potential of target enrichment methods combined with next-generation sequencing for molecular diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia. adopting these assays for patients with suspected familial hypercholesterolemia could improve cost-effectiveness and increase the overall number of patients with a molecular diagnosis.	-1
a molecular screening strategy based on beta-myosin heavy chain, cardiac myosin binding protein c and troponin t genes in italian patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) have been described in nine different genes of the sarcomere. three genes account for most known mutations: beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7), cardiac myosin binding protein c (mybpc3) and cardiac troponin t (tnnt2). their prevalence in italian hcm patients is unknown. thus, we prospectively assessed a molecular screening strategy of these three genes in a consecutive population with hcm from two italian centres. comprehensive screening of mybpc3, myh7 and tnnt2 was performed in 88 unrelated hcm patients by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automatic sequencing. we identified 32 mutations in 50 patients (57%); 16 were novel. the prevalence rates for mybpc3, myh7 and tnnt2 were 32%, 17% and 2%, respectively. mybpc3 mutations were 18, including two frameshift, five splice-site and two nonsense. all were 'private' except insc1065 and r502q, present in three and two patients, respectively. moreover, e258k was found in 14% of patients, suggesting a founder effect. myh7 mutations were 12, all missense; seven were novel. in tnnt2, only two mutations were found. in addition, five patients had a complex genotype [i.e. carried a double mybpc3 mutation (n = 2), or were double heterozygous for mutations in mybpc3 and myh7 (n = 3)]. the first comprehensive evaluation of mybpc3, myh7 and tnnt2 in an italian hcm population allowed a genetic diagnosis in 57% of the patients. these data support a combined analysis of the three major sarcomeric genes as a rational and cost-effective initial approach to the molecular screening of hcm.	-1
human gene-centered transcription factor networks for enhancers and disease variants.  gene regulatory networks (grns) comprising interactions between transcription factors (tfs) and regulatory loci control development and physiology. numerous disease-associated mutations have been identified, the vast majority residing in non-coding regions of the genome. as current grn mapping methods test one tf at a time and require the use of cells harboring the mutation(s) of interest, they are not suitable to identify tfs that bind to wild-type and mutant loci. here, we use gene-centered yeast one-hybrid (ey1h) assays to interrogate binding of 1,086 human tfs to 246 enhancers, as well as to 109 non-coding disease mutations. we detect both loss and gain of tf interactions with mutant loci that are concordant with target gene expression changes. this work establishes ey1h assays as a powerful addition to the toolkit of mapping human grns and for the high-throughput characterization of genomic variants that are rapidly being identified by genome-wide association studies.	1
the electrocardiogram is a more sensitive indicator than echocardiography of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in families with a mutation in the myh7 gene.  mutations in the cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been identified, and to assist both diagnosis and prediction of outcome attempts have been made to correlate phenotype and genotype. two new mutations in codon 403 of the gene in three unrelated families are described and attention drawn to variable or even absent phenotypic expression in different family members. the polymerase chain reaction and heteroduplex analysis on mutation detection enhancement gels were used to search for mutations in the globular head of the beta myosin heavy chain gene in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. two mutations were found in exon 13 (codon 403) of the gene. in two unrelated polish families the mutation resulted in the conversion of arginine to tryptophan (cgg: >tgg). a second mutation, found in a british family, converted the same arginine to leucine (cgg: >ctg). these mutations were detected in family members who had electrocardiographic and echocardiographic features typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, they were also detected in 7 other adult relatives with an abnormal electrocardiogram but a normal echocardiogram. two unrelated adult relatives had completely normal clinical findings but carried the gene mutation. identification of a specific mutation gives no guide to the clinical phenotype. there is considerable variability in the phenotypic expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. mutations were detected in adults previously regarded as normal or in whom the diagnosis was questionable. the fact that the clinical significance of the mutation in these people is still unknown emphasises the dilemma facing screening programmes. isolated, unexplained electrocardiographic abnormalities in first degree relatives in a family with a definitive diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy should be regarded as evidence of a carrier state.	-1
e-cadherin genetic screening and clinico-pathologic characteristics of early onset gastric cancer.  cdh1 germline alterations occur in about 40% of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) families. cdh1 germline mutations are also documented in few early onset diffuse gastric cancer patients (eodgc) without family history, but the real frequency in this setting in unknown. in these patients, the advanced stage at the time of diagnosis remains a clinical burden due to the poor long term survival. the entire coding region and exon flanking sequences of the cdh1 gene was analysed by direct sequencing in 21 eodgc patients aged ?50 years. the potential deleterious nature for a new cdh1 missense variant was assessed by cell-cell aggregation and invasion assays. somatic cdh1 mutation, loss of heterozygosity (loh) and promoter hypermethylation was explored in the tumour from one cdh1 germline mutation carrier. two novel cdh1 germline variants were identified in 21 eodgc cases, c.670c>t and -63c>a. functional analysis of the c.670c>t missense variant classified this mutation as non-pathogenic. the analysis of cdh1 somatic second hits failed to demonstrate e-cadherin structural and epigenetic alterations in the tumour sample. data from the present work and a systematic review of the literature revealed that cdh1 germline mutations occurred in 7.2% of eogc patients invariably with diffuse of mixed histology. from these, proved cdh1 mutation pathogenicity has been assigned only to 2.3% of the cases who were recurrently diagnosed before 35 years old. germline cdh1 mutation remain the only germline genetic defect described in this type of patients and cdh1 mutation screening should be recommended for patients with these characteristics.	1
targeted exome sequencing identified novel ush2a mutations in usher syndrome families.  usher syndrome (ush) is a leading cause of deaf-blindness in autosomal recessive trait. phenotypic and genetic heterogeneities in ush make molecular diagnosis much difficult. this is a pilot study aiming to develop an approach based on next-generation sequencing to determine the genetic defects in patients with ush or allied diseases precisely and effectively. eight affected patients and twelve unaffected relatives from five unrelated chinese ush families, including 2 pseudo-dominant ones, were recruited. a total of 144 known genes of inherited retinal diseases were selected for deep exome resequencing. through systematic data analysis using established bioinformatics pipeline and segregation analysis, a number of genetic variants were released. eleven mutations, eight of them were novel, in the ush2a gene were identified. biparental mutations in ush2a were revealed in 2 families with pseudo-dominant inheritance. a proband was found to have triple mutations, two of them were supposed to locate in the same chromosome. in conclusion, this study revealed the genetic defects in the ush2a gene and demonstrated the robustness of targeted exome sequencing to precisely and rapidly determine genetic defects. the methodology provides a reliable strategy for routine gene diagnosis of ush.	-1
diverse pah transcripts in lymphocytes of pku patients with putative nonsense (g272x, y356x) and missense (p281l, r408q) mutations.  the majority of mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene that lead to the recessive disease phenylketonuria (pku) are believed to affect the activity or stability of the pah enzyme. in this study we have performed in vivo analyses of lymphocyte pah mrna from pku patients homozygous for the pku missense mutations p281l and r408q as well as the nonsense mutations g272x and y356x. the mutations g272x, p281l and r408q, which are located outside the consensus splice site sequence, result in transcripts with one or more exons skipped in addition to full-length transcripts. the mutation y356x results in transcripts with one or more exons skipped, but no full-length transcripts. our findings question the value of functional and structural predictions of mutations at the protein level without analyses of the corresponding transcript.	1
evaluation of genotype-phenotype relationships in patients referred for endocrine assessment in suspected pendred syndrome.  patients with pendred syndrome have genotypic and phenotypic variability, leading to challenges in definitive diagnosis. deaf children with enlarged vestibular aqueducts are often subjected to repeated investigations when tests for mutations in slc26a4 are abnormal. this study provides genotype and phenotype information from patients with suspected pendred syndrome referred to a single clinical endocrinology unit. a retrospective analysis of 50 patients with suspected pendred syndrome to investigate the correlation between genetic, perchlorate discharge test (pdt) and endocrine status. eight patients with monoallelic slc26a4 mutations had normal pdt. of the 33 patients with biallelic mutations, ten of 12 patients with >30% discharge developed hypothyroidism. in our cohort, c.626g>t and c.3-2a>g result in milder clinical presentations with lower median perchlorate discharge of 9.3% (interquartile range 4-15%) compared with 40% (interquartile range 21-60%) for the remaining mutations. eight novel mutations were detected. all patients with pdt <30% remained euthyroid to date, although the majority are still under the age of 30. there was a significant correlation between pdt and goitre size (r=0.61, p=0.0009) and the age of onset of hypothyroidism (r=-0.62, p=0.0297). in our population, the hazard of becoming hypothyroid increased by 7% per percentage point increase in pdt (p<0.001). there is a correlation between slc26a4 genotype and thyroid phenotype. if results hold true for larger patient numbers and longer follow-up, then for patients with monoallelic mutations, pdt could be unnecessary. patients with biallelic mutations and pdt discharge >30% have a high risk of developing goitre and hypothyroidism, and should have lifelong monitoring.	-1
the genetics of usher syndrome in the israeli and palestinian populations.  usher syndrome (ush) is the most common cause for deaf-blindness. it is genetically and clinically heterogeneous and prevalent in populations with high consanguinity rate. we aim to characterize the set of genes and mutations that cause ush in the israeli and palestinian populations. seventy-four families with ush were recruited (23 with ush type 1 [ush1], 33 with ush2, seven with ush3, four with atypical ush, and seven families with an undetermined ush type). all affected subjects underwent a full ocular evaluation. a comprehensive genetic analysis, including sanger sequencing for the detection of founder mutations, homozygosity mapping, and whole exome sequencing in large families was performed. in 79% of the families (59 out of 74), an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern could be determined. mutation detection analysis led to the identification of biallelic causative mutations in 51 (69%) of the families, including 21 families with mutations in ush2a, 17 in myo7a, and seven in clrn1. our analysis revealed 28 mutations, 11 of which are novel (including c.802g>a, c.8558+1g>t, c.10211del, and c.14023a>t in ush2a; c.285+2t>g, c.2187+1g>t, c.3892g>a, c.5069_5070insc, c.5101c>t, and c.6196c>t in myo7a; and c.15494del in gpr98). we report here novel homozygous mutations in various genes causing ush, extending the spectrum of causative mutations. we also prove combined sequencing techniques as useful tools to identify novel disease-causing mutations. to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest report of a genetic analysis of israeli and palestinian families (n = 74) with different ush subtypes.	-1
screening of slc26a4, foxi1, kcnj10, and gjb2 in bilateral deafness patients with inner ear malformation.  bilateral nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss associated with inner ear malformation is closely related to genetics. slc26a4 is considered to be the major involved gene. recently, foxi1 and kcnj10 mutations have been linked to enlarged vestibular aqueducts and gjb2 mutations linked to temporal bone malformation. the authors aimed to investigate the mutation spectrums of these genes in chinese patients with bilateral hearing impairment associated with inner ear malformation. cross-sectional study. affiliated hospital of the university. the authors analyzed the gjb2, slc26a4, foxi1, and kcnj10 gene sequences in 43 patients presenting with bilateral hearing impairment associated with inner ear malformation using pyrosequencing and direct dna sequencing. in total, 74.4% (32/43) of patients carried at least 1 of 14 pathogenic slc26a4 mutations, including 6 novel mutations and 4 polymorphisms. patients with enlarged vestibular aqueducts had a higher rate of slc26a4 mutation than mondini dysplasia patients. no foxi1 or kcnj10 potential pathogenic mutation was present, and gjb2 biallelic pathogenic mutations were uncommon (2.3%; 1/43). no significant correlation was observed between the genotype and phenotype of slc26a4 mutations. slc26a4 accounts for 74.4% of inner ear malformations in our cohort, whereas foxi1, kcnj10, and gjb2 mutations are not common. other possible genes or external factors may contribute to this multibranch abnormality.	-1
novel variants in the mc4r and lepr genes among severely obese children from the iberian population.  we screened for mutations in the mc4r and lepr genes and investigated the genotype-phenotype correlation in obese individuals belonging to families with evident hereditary patterns of severe and early-onset obesity among the iberian population. a total of 202 unrelated and severely obese patients since childhood, were enrolled in the study. bidirectional sequencing of the mc4r gene was carried out in all patients; the lepr gene was sequenced in 15 individuals based on additional clinical signals. segregation analysis and/or genotype-phenotype description was performed for subjects with the new mutations and with presumably functional variants. ten mc4r gene mutations were identified in the heterozygous state in 10 patients. mutations p.r147g and p.g323e are new and mutations p.r7h, p.g32e, p.h76r, p.v103i, p.s127l, p.t150i, p.i251l and p.g252s were previously described. a new dinucleotide insertion -77_-76insta in the promoter region of the lepr gene was found in the heterozygous state in one patient. the new p.r147g and the previously published p.r7h, p.s127l, p.t150i and p.g252s mc4r mutations, cosegregate with obesity in our patients and were predicted to be deleterious. for the novel mc4r p.g323e and lepr -77_-76insta gene mutations, the genotype-phenotype correlation and bioinformatic analysis did not clarify whether these mutations are indeed implicated in obesity.	-1
increasing knowledge of pten germline mutations: two additional patients with autism and macrocephaly.  recently, butler et al. [2005; j med genet 42:318-321] reported the presence of heterozygous germline mutations in the pten tumor suppressor gene in three children with autism and macrocephaly. here, we report the presence of pten mutations in two additional unrelated children with macrocephaly and autism. our findings extend those of butler et al. and suggest that pten gene sequencing should be included in the genetic evaluation of this subset of autistic individuals.	-1
enlarged vestibular aqueduct: a radiological marker of pendred syndrome, and mutation of the pds gene.  although the textbook view of pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in pendred syndrome and mutations in the pds (pendred syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of pendred syndrome. since this is the most common radiological malformation of the cochlea in deaf patients, we investigated what proportion of such cases were due to mutation of the pds gene. we assessed 57 patients referred with radiological evidence of vestibular aqueduct enlargement, by history, clinical examination, perchlorate discharge test and molecular analysis of the pds locus. forty-one patients (72%) had unequivocal evidence of pendred syndrome. the finding of a single heterozygous mutation at the pds gene in a further eight was strongly suggestive of a critical role for pendrin, the protein product of the pds gene, in the generation of enlarged vestibular aqueducts in at least 86% (49/57 cases) of patients with this radiological malformation. securing the diagnosis of pendred syndrome may be difficult, especially in the single case. goitre is an inconstant finding, and the perchlorate discharge test, although helpful, is of diagnostic value only if abnormal. enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct should be considered as the most likely presentation of pendred syndrome and should prompt specific investigation of that diagnostic possibility. pendred syndrome might henceforth be recharacterized as deafness with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, which is sometimes associated with goitre.	-1
association of rare and common variation in the lipoprotein lipase gene with coronary artery disease.  the activity of lipoprotein lipase (lpl) is the rate-determining step in clearing triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation. mutations that damage the lpl gene (lpl) lead to lifelong deficiency in enzymatic activity and can provide insight into the relationship of lpl to human disease. to determine whether rare and/or common variants in lpl are associated with early-onset coronary artery disease (cad). in a cross-sectional study, lpl was sequenced in 10 cad case-control cohorts of the multinational myocardial infarction genetics consortium and a nested cad case-control cohort of the geisinger health system discovehr cohort between 2010 and 2015. common variants were genotyped in up to 305 699 individuals of the global lipids genetics consortium and up to 120 600 individuals of the cardiogram exome consortium between 2012 and 2014. study-specific estimates were pooled via meta-analysis. rare damaging mutations in lpl included loss-of-function variants and missense variants annotated as pathogenic in a human genetics database or predicted to be damaging by computer prediction algorithms trained to identify mutations that impair protein function. common variants in the lpl gene region included those independently associated with circulating triglyceride levels. circulating lipid levels and cad. among 46 891 individuals with lpl gene sequencing data available, the mean (sd) age was 50 (12.6) years and 51% were female. a total of 188 participants (0.40%; 95% ci, 0.35%-0.46%) carried a damaging mutation in lpl, including 105 of 32 646 control participants (0.32%) and 83 of 14 245 participants with early-onset cad (0.58%). compared with 46 703 noncarriers, the 188 heterozygous carriers of an lpl damaging mutation displayed higher plasma triglyceride levels (19.6 mg/dl; 95% ci, 4.6-34.6 mg/dl) and higher odds of cad (odds ratio = 1.84; 95% ci, 1.35-2.51; p < .001). an analysis of 6 common lpl variants resulted in an odds ratio for cad of 1.51 (95% ci, 1.39-1.64; p = 1.1  10-22) per 1-sd increase in triglycerides. the presence of rare damaging mutations in lpl was significantly associated with higher triglyceride levels and presence of coronary artery disease. however, further research is needed to assess whether there are causal mechanisms by which heterozygous lipoprotein lipase deficiency could lead to coronary artery disease.	-1
hydrops fetalis in a preterm newborn heterozygous for the c.4a>g shoc2 mutation.  fetal hydrops is a condition resulting from interstitial fluid accumulation in fetal compartments secondary to increased capillary permeability and characterized by high rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity. clinical features include skin edema, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, ascites with or without polyhydramnios, and placental edema. while it may occur as associated feature in multiple disorders, it has been documented to recur in noonan syndrome, the most common disorder among rasopathies, but also in cardiofaciocutaneous and costello syndromes. here, we report on the occurrence of severe hydrops in a newborn heterozygous for the invariant c.4a>g missense change in shoc2 which underlies noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair, documenting that it represents a clinically relevant complication in this condition, shared by rasopathies.	-1
a prevalent missense mutation in northern europe associated with hyperphenylalaninaemia.  a missense mutation has been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene of a danish patient with hyperphenylalaninaemia (hpa). an a-to-g transition at the second base of codon 414 results in the substitution of cys for tyr in the mutant pah protein. in in vitro expression studies, the tyr414-to-cys414 mutant construct produced a protein which exhibited a significant amount of normal pah enzyme activity, which is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo measurements of pah activity in hpa patients. population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is present on 50% of mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the danish population. together with the previously reported codon 158 mutation, these two mutant alleles comprise over 90% of all mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the northern european population. thus, two allele-specific oligonucleotide probes can detect most mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in northern europe.	1
severe cardiomyopathy as the isolated presenting feature in an adult with late-onset pompe disease: a case report.  many inborn errors of metabolism can cause cardiomyopathy. cardiomyopathy associated with glycogen storage includes prkag2-associated glycogen storage disease (gsd), danon disease, infantile-onset pompe disease (gsd ii), gsd iii, gsd iv, and phosphofructokinase deficiency (tarui disease or gsd vii).we present a 35-year-old female who presented with cardiomyopathy after a pregnancy complicated by primary hyperparathyroidism. she had enjoyed excellent health until her first pregnancy at age 33. one week postpartum, she developed dyspnea and an echocardiogram revealed left ventricular ejection fraction (lvef) of 35%. a cardiac mri was consistent with nonischemic cardiomyopathy with an infiltrative process. endomyocardial biopsy showed striking sarcoplasmic vacuolization, excess glycogen by pas staining, and frequent membrane-bound glycogen by electron microscopy, consistent with lysosomal gsd. acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) activity in skin fibroblasts was in the affected range for pompe disease. sequencing of the gaa gene revealed a paternally inherited pathogenic c.525delt (p.glu176argfs*45) and a de novo c.309c>g (p.cys103trp) with unknown pathogenicity. testing of the familial mutations in her daughter indicated that the variants in the proband were in trans. 26-gene cardiomyopathy sequencing panel had normal results thereby excluding gsd iii, danon disease, fabry disease, and prkag2-associated cardiomyopathy. therefore, results strongly suggest a diagnosis of pompe disease.pompe disease has a broad disease spectrum, including infantile-onset (iopd) and late-onset (lopd) forms. lopd typically presents with proximal muscle weakness and respiratory insufficiency in childhood or late adulthood. our case may represent a very unusual presentation of adult lopd with isolated cardiomyopathy without skeletal muscle involvement or respiratory failure.	-1
alternative splicing in the alpha-galactosidase a gene: increased exon inclusion results in the fabry cardiac phenotype.  fabry disease is an inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, resulting from deficient activity of lysosomal alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a). a rare alternative splicing that introduces a 57-nucleotide (nt) intronic sequence to the alpha-gal a transcript from intron 4 of the gene has been identified. in addition, a novel midintronic base substitution that results in substantially increased alternative splicing has been identified in a patient with fabry disease who has the cardiac variant phenotype. the sequence of the patient's intron 4 contains a single g-->a transversion at genomic nt 9331 (ivs4+919 g-->a ), located at the minus sign4 position of the 3' end of the intronic insertion (nts 9278--9334 in the genomic sequence). minigene constructs containing the entire intron 4 sequence with g, a, c, or t at nt 9331 within an alpha-gal a complementary dna expression vector were prepared and expressed in cos-1 cells. whereas transfection of the g or t minigenes transcribed predominantly normal-sized transcripts, the transfection of the a or c minigenes produced a large amount of the alternatively spliced transcript. these results suggest that the g-->a mutation, within an a/c-rich domain, results in increased recognition of the alternative splicing by an a/c-rich enhancer-type exonic splicing enhancer. the intronic mutation was not observed in 100 unrelated unaffected men but was present in 6 unrelated patients with cardiac fabry disease. reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of total rna of various normal human tissues revealed that the alternatively spliced transcript was present in all of the samples, and especially at a higher ratio in the lung and muscle. the normal transcript was present in the patients' lymphoblasts and resulted in approximately 10% residual enzyme activity, leading to a cardiac phenotype of fabry disease.	1
the mutation spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene and associated haplotypes reveal ethnic heterogeneity in the taiwanese population.  phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency is responsible for most cases of phenylketonuria (pku). in this study of the pah mutation spectrum in the taiwanese population, 139 alleles were identified including 34 different mutations. the v190g, q267r and f392i mutations are first reported in this study. the most common mutations, r241c, r408q and ex6-96a>g, account for 23.2%, 12.0% and 9.2%, of the mutant alleles, respectively. haplotype analysis shows that r241c and ex6-96a>g are exclusively associated with haplotype 4.3 to suggest founder effects. on the other hand, r408q is found on two distinct haplotypes suggesting recurrent mutations. the spectrum of pah mutations in taiwan shows various links to those of other asian regions, yet remarkable differences exist. notably, r408q, e286k and -4173_-407del, accounting for 21% of all mutant alleles in taiwan, are very rare or are undetected among pku cohorts of other asian regions to suggest local founder effects. moreover, the low homozygosity value of 0.092 hints at a high degree of ethnic heterogeneity within the taiwanese population. our study of pah mutation spectrum and the associated haplotypes is useful for subsequent study on the origin and migration pattern via taiwan, an island at the historical crossroad of migration of ancient populations.	1
germline kras and braf mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome.  cardio-facio-cutaneous (cfc) syndrome is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects and mental retardation. it phenotypically overlaps with noonan and costello syndrome, which are caused by mutations in ptpn11 and hras, respectively. in 43 individuals with cfc, we identified two heterozygous kras mutations in three individuals and eight braf mutations in 16 individuals, suggesting that dysregulation of the ras-raf-erk pathway is a common molecular basis for the three related disorders.	1
comparison of echocardiographic and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy sarcomere mutation carriers without left ventricular hypertrophy.  left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) typically manifests during or after adolescence in sarcomere mutation carriers at risk for developing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. guidelines recommend serial imaging of mutation carriers without lvh (g+/lvh-) to monitor for phenotypic evolution, but the optimal strategy is undefined. compared with echocardiography (echo), cardiac mri (cmr) offers improved endocardial visualization and potential to assess scar. however, the incremental advantage offered by cmr for early diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is unclear. therefore, we systematically compared echo and cmr in g+/lvh- subjects. a total of 40 sarcomere mutation carriers with normal echo wall thickness (<12 mm or z score <2.5 in children) underwent concurrent cmr. mean age was 21.711.1 years, 55% were female. if left ventricular wall thickness seemed nonuniform, the size and location of relatively thickened segments were noted. late gadolinium enhancement was assessed with cmr. diagnostic agreement between echo and cmr was good (90%), although cmr measurements of left ventricular wall thickness were ?19% lower than echo. four subjects had mild hypertrophy (12.6-14 mm; ?2 segments) appreciated by cmr but not echo. no subjects had late gadolinium enhancement. during median 35-month follow-up, 2 subjects developed overt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, including 1 with mild lvh by cmr at baseline. echo is unlikely to miss substantial lvh; however, cmr identified mild hypertrophy in ?10% of mutation carriers with normal echo wall thickness. cmr may be a useful adjunct in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy family screening, particularly in higher risk situations, or if echocardiographic images are suboptimal or suggest borderline lvh.	-1
inheritance patterns and phenotypic features of myofibrillar myopathy associated with a bag3 mutation.  myofibrillar myopathies are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by disintegration of myofibrils. the inheritance pattern is commonly autosomal dominant, but there has been a striking absence of secondary cases noted in a bag3-associated subtype. we studied three families with bag3 p.pro209leu mutation showing a severe phenotype of myofibrillar myopathy and axonal neuropathy with giant axons. in one family, transmission to a pair of siblings has occurred from their asymptomatic father who showed somatic mosaicism. in two other families, neither of the parents was affected or showed detectable level of somatic mosaicism. these observations suggest that the bag3 variant of myofibrillar myopathy may result from a spontaneous mutation at an early point of embryonic development and that transmission from a mosaic parent may occur more than once. the study underlines the importance of parental evaluation as it may have implications for genetic counseling.	-1
carrier frequency of the gjb2 mutations that cause hereditary hearing loss in the japanese population.  hearing impairment is one of the most common sensory disorders that affect ~1 in 1000 children, and half of them are considered to be hereditary. information about the carrier frequencies of mutations that underlie autosomal recessive disorders is indispensable for accurate genetic counseling to predict the probability of patients' children's disease. however, there have been few reports specific to the japanese population. gjb2 mutations are reported to be the most frequent cause of hereditary hearing loss, and the mutation spectrum and frequency of gjb2 mutations were reported to vary among different ethnic groups. in this study, we investigated the carrier frequency of gjb2 mutations and the mutation spectrum in 509 individuals randomly selected from the general japanese population. we show that the carrier frequencies of the two most common pathogenic mutations are 1.57% (8/509) for c.235delc and 1.77% (9/509) for p.val37ile. in addition to these mutations, we found two pathogenic variants (p.[gly45glu;tyr136*] and p.arg143trp), and the total carrier frequency was estimated to be around 3.73% (19/509). we also detected six unclassified variants, including two novel variants (p.cys60tyr and p.phe106leu), with the former predicted to be pathogenic. these findings will provide indispensable information for genetic counseling in the japanese population.	-1
li-fraumeni and li-fraumeni-like syndrome mutations in p53 are associated with exonic methylation and splicing regulatory elements.  mutations in codon 133 of p53, which cause the loss of the delta 133 isoform(s) expression, are very frequent in the li-fraumeni (lf) and li-fraumeni-like (lfl) syndromes. in sporadic cancers, silent p53 mutations are correlated with exonic splicing enhancers (eses) and exonic methylated sites. the present study shows that mutations in splice sites are also very frequent in lf/lfl syndromes, while missense mutations are less common compared to other familial or sporadic cancers (p = 0 in both cases). furthermore, it is shown that the codons at which lf/lfl germline missense mutations occur, correlate with cpg-containing eses (r = 0.181, p = 0.014) which are all methylated in p53. while both silent and lf/lfl missense mutations correlate with sc35 motifs, only the latter are associated with srp55. on the contrary, only silent mutations in sporadic cancers correlate with sf2/asf motifs in p53. moreover, 12.1% of lf/lfl missense mutations involve the formation of potential splice sites of considerable splicing scores. finally, mutations that are not at, or adjacent to cpgs (+/-1 codon, 34% of all lf/lfl mutated sites), introduce considerable changes of the ese scores (>1.3 score change). the above data verify that lf/lfl missense mutations probably result also in splicing deregulation, in addition to any changes of the protein function and are mostly associated with alterations of the exonic methylation landscape. some of the eses affected in lf/lfl syndromes are also genetically unstable in sporadic cancers but non-cpg cytosine instability, which is predominantly associated with specific eses, is only common in sporadic cancers.	1
pompe disease: dramatic improvement in gastrointestinal function following enzyme replacement therapy. a report of three later-onset patients.  pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disease due to deficient acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) activity. infants with the classic infantile-onset subtype present with severe hypotonia and cardiomegaly, and most expire in the first year of life, whereas the severity of the muscle-based manifestations in patients with the late infantile/juvenile and adult-onset subtypes depends on the level of gaa residual enzymatic activity. the clinical features of later-onset pompe disease are still emerging, and even the natural history and progression of muscle weakness and respiratory failure, hallmarks of the later-onset subtypes, are not well documented. for example, we report here three later-onset patients who had chronic diarrhea, postprandial bloating and abdominal pain, previously unrecognized manifestations of later-onset pompe disease. two patients had intestinal incontinence and one reported synchronous vomiting and diarrhea on a daily basis. these symptoms significantly interfered with their quality of life, often limiting their ability to leave home. all gastrointestinal symptoms resolved within the first six months of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human alglucosidase alpha (rhgaa). all three patients gained weight and remain symptom free, two for over four years. thus, gastrointestinal symptoms occur in later-onset patients with pompe disease and are resolved with ert.	-1
familial hyperglycemia due to mutations in glucokinase. definition of a subtype of diabetes mellitus.  non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (niddm) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. maturity-onset diabetes of the young, a form of niddm with an early age of onset and autosomal dominant inheritance, can result from mutations in glucokinase, a key enzyme of glucose metabolism in beta cells and the liver. we studied 32 french families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young as well as 21 families with late-onset niddm to determine the frequency and clinical features of mutations of glucokinase. fasting plasma glucose concentrations and oral glucose-tolerance tests were used to determine metabolic status. dna was isolated from lymphocytes, and dna polymorphisms in the glucokinase gene were tested for linkage with diabetes. individual exons of the glucokinase gene from one affected member in each family were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by analysis of the conformation-dependent polymorphisms of single-stranded dna and by dna sequencing. we found substantial evidence of linkage between the glucokinase locus and maturity-onset diabetes of the young but not between this locus and late-onset niddm: sixteen mutations were identified in 18 of the 32 families with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, but none were found in families with late-onset niddm: they included 10 mutations that resulted in an amino acid substitution, 3 that resulted in the synthesis of a truncated protein, and 3 that affected rna processing. the affected subjects with glucokinase mutations usually had mild hyperglycemia that began during childhood, whereas in subjects with maturity-onset diabetes of the young not due to glucokinase mutations, hyperglycemia usually appeared after puberty. mutations in glucokinase are the primary cause of hyperglycemia in a substantial fraction of french patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and result in a relatively mild form of niddm that can be diagnosed in childhood.	-1
co-existence of phenylketonuria either with maple syrup urine disease or sandhoff disease in two patients from iran: emphasizing the role of consanguinity.  most inborn errors of metabolism (iems) are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. iems are one of the major concerns in iran due to its extensive consanguineous marriages. herein, we report two patients with two co-existent iems: a girl affected by classic phenylketonuria (pku) and maple syrup urine disease (msud) and a male patient affected with sandhoff disease and pku, where sandhoff disease was suspected due to the presence of a cherry-red spot in the eyes at 6 months which is unrelated to pku. sequencing of candidate genes in the first patient revealed one novel and three recurrent compound heterozygous mutations of p.ser231pro and p.ala300ser in the pah gene and p.glu330lys and p.arg170cys mutations in the bckdhb gene. genetic testing results in the second patient showed previously reported homozygous mutations of p.arg261gln in the pah and p.arg533cys mutation in the hexb gene. genetic testing confirmed the clinical diagnosis of both diseases in both patients. to the best of our knowledge; this is the first report of the co-existence of two distinct genetic disorders in two individuals from iran. co-existent different iems in patients complicated the clinical diagnosis and management of the diseases.	-1
a novel mutation of the beta myosin heavy chain gene responsible for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is the most common inherited cardiac disorder and shows high variability in genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic characteristics. the genetic etiology responsible for hcm in many individuals remains unclear. this instigation was sought to identify novel genetic determinants for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. six unrelated chinese families with hcm were studied. for each of the 13 established hcm-susceptibility genes, 3 to 5 microsatellite markers were selected to perform genotyping and haplotype analysis. the linked genes were sequenced. haplotype analyses on candidate genetic loci revealed cosegregation of the gene beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7) with hcm in a single family. a novel double heterozygous missense mutation of ala26val plus arg719trp in myh7 was subsequently identified by sequencing in this family and was associated with a severe phenotype of hcm. the novel double mutation of ala26val plus arg719trp in myh7 identified in a chinese family highlights the remarkable genetic heterogeneity of hcm, which provides important information for genetic counseling, accurate diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and appropriate clinical management.	-1
enhancing the diagnosis of fabry disease in cardiology with a targeted information: a before-after control-impact study.  cardiac complications in fabry disease are frequent and dominated by a high frequency of left ventricular hypertrophy; therefore, cardiologists may have an essential role in screening for this disease. providing cardiologists with targeted information on fabry disease would be valuable and could reduce both diagnostic and therapeutic delays. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of such strategy for fabry screening. we conducted a before-after control-impact study by comparing observations made before and after targeted information on fabry disease among cardiologists. the information on fabry disease consisted of (1) an educational booklet, (2) oral information and (3) screening kits. the programme was evaluated at the end of a 12-month study period. forty-two cardiologists participated to this study. none of them had conducted screening test and new diagnostic for fabry disease in the 3 years prior the information. after the information, screening with dried blood spots was performed in 55 patients (ranged 18-77 years, men: 39) with cardiac monitoring for supposed sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=41) or unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (n=14) from january 2015 to january 2016. two new cases of fabry disease were diagnosed (3.4%) in two men (ages 58 and 51 years). the information was deemed relevant in both content and structure and was deemed useful for everyday practice. cardiologists valued the targeted information on fabry disease. this information had a direct clinical impact by allowing the diagnosis of two new families with fabry disease.	-1
germline mutations in the palb2 gene are population specific and occur with low frequencies in familial breast cancer.  the partner and localizer of brca2 (palb2) protein has been linked to fanconi anemia and breast cancer predisposition. here we present data of a comprehensive mutation screening of the palb2 gene in 818 familial cases of breast cancer from germany. by analyzing the entire coding region of palb2, we found seven truncating mutations (six of them novel) in families tested negative for brca1/2-mutations. in addition, two novel potentially disease causing missense mutations were found. remarkably, only one mutation reported previously in other populations, was also identified in the german population. no palb2 mutation carriers were identified in 450 unaffected controls. thus, our observations indicate a low prevalence of deleterious palb2 mutations and a specific mutation profile within the german population. as palb2-deficient tumors were shown to be sensitive to poly(adp-ribose) polymerase (parp) inhibitors, our study has implications for newly developed, favorable treatment options in familial breast cancer.	1
digenic inheritance of deafness caused by mutations in genes encoding cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 in mice and humans.  mutations in genes coding for cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 cause deafness in both mice and humans. here, we provide evidence that mutations at these two cadherin loci can interact to cause hearing loss in digenic heterozygotes of both species. using a classical genetic approach, we generated mice that were heterozygous for both cdh23 and pcdh15 mutations on a uniform c57bl/6j background. significant levels of hearing loss were detected in these mice when compared to age-matched single heterozygous animals or normal controls. cytoarchitectural defects in the cochlea of digenic heterozygotes, including degeneration of the stereocilia and a base-apex loss of hair cells and spiral ganglion cells, were consistent with the observed age-related hearing loss of these mice beginning with the high frequencies. in humans, we also have obtained evidence for a digenic inheritance of a ush1 phenotype in three unrelated families with mutations in cdh23 and pcdh15. altogether, our data indicate that cdh23 and pcdh15 play an essential long-term role in maintaining the normal organization of the stereocilia bundle.	-1
prevalence, spectrum, and functional characterization of melanocortin-4 receptor gene mutations in a representative population-based sample and obese adults from germany.  autosomal dominant inheritance of mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (mc4r) is currently regarded as the most relevant genetic cause for extreme obesity and affects 2-4% of extremely obese individuals. our objective was to assess the relevance of mc4r mutations in a german population-based sample. we conducted a mutation screen of the mc4r gene by capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and denaturing hplc. subjects included 4068 individuals of a german population-based study group [kooperative gesundheitsforschung im raum augsburg, survey 4 (kora-s4); i.e. cooperative health research in the region of augsburg] and 1003 german obese adults (body mass index >or= 30 kg/m(2)). samples with aberrant capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis/denaturing hplc patterns were resequenced. functional studies including agonistic receptor stimulation (nle-d-phe-alpha-, alpha-, and beta-msh) and cell surface expression assays were performed. sixteen (six novel) coding nonsynonymous mutations were detected in 27 heterozygous individuals of kora-s4. four of the mutation alleles led to impaired receptor function in vitro; however, none of these six heterozygous mutation carriers was obese (body mass index >or= 30 kg/m(2)). in the obese adults, six coding nonsynonymous and a nonsense mutation were detected in 13 individuals. only the nonsense mutation allele entailed impaired receptor function. our study depicts prevalence, spectrum, and functional characterization of mc4r mutations in the german population-based sample kora-s4. in this epidemiological study group, individuals heterozygous for nonsynonymous mc4r mutation alleles entailing impaired function were not obese. furthermore, nonsynonymous mc4r mutations causing impaired receptor function were rare in german obese adults (two in 1003 = 0.2%).	-1
mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in chinese familial hypercholesterolemia patients.  it has been reported that in china, patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) may go unrecognized because they do not have xanthomata or premature coronary heart disease and their ldl cholesterol levels are lower than those in their western counterparts. however, in the chinese patients in hong kong, heterozygous fh appears to manifest in a way similar to that seen in western countries or japan. we studied sequence variations in the promoter and coding regions of the 18 exons of the ldl receptor gene in 30 chinese fh patients. eighteen mutations were identified in 21 patients scattered in the promoter and 10 exons. eleven of them were first found in this study. we also found 6 polymorphisms with allelic frequencies different from those in whites but similar to the japanese, indicating some isolation between white and oriental populations. a total of 29 mutations in the ldl receptor gene are now known in the chinese. there is no definite common mutation due to a founder effect. meanwhile, there were no detectable ldl receptor gene mutations in 9 clinically diagnosed fh patients in whom the r3500q mutation in apolipoprotein b had also been excluded. the gene defects leading to the fh phenotype in these patients may occur somewhere else in the apolipoprotein b or other related genes, or even in the noncoding sequences of the ldl receptor gene.	-1
"molecular genetics of pku in poland and potential impact of mutations on bh4 responsiveness.  tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) has been recently approved as a treatment of patients with phenylketonuria. however, as a confirmation of bh4-responsiveness, it might require a very expensive trial treatment with bh4 or prolonged bh4-loading procedures. the selection of patients eligible for bh4-therapy by means of genotyping of the pah gene mutations may be recommended as a complementary approach. a population-wide genotyping study was carried out in 1286 polish phenyloketonuria-patients. the aim was to estimate the bh4 demand and to cover prospectively the treatment by a national health fund. a total of 95 types of mutations were identified. genetic variants corresponding with probable bh4-responsiveness were found in 28.2% of cases. however, patients with mild or classical phenylketonuria who require continuous treatment accounted for 11.4% of the studied population only. analysis of the published data shows similar percentage of the ""bh4-responsive"" variants of a pah gene in patients from other countries of eastern europe. therefore, it can be concluded, that the proportion of phenylketonuria-patients who could benefit from the use of bh4 reaches approximately 10% in the entire region."	-1
identification of a missense mutation in one allele of a patient with pompe disease, and use of endonuclease digestion of pcr-amplified rna to demonstrate lack of mrna expression from the second allele.  infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type ii, or pompe disease, results from a genetic deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase (gaa). sequencing of the cdna from a cell line (gm 244) derived from a patient with pompe disease demonstrated a t953-to-c transition that predicted a methionine-to-threonine substitution at codon 318. the basepair substitution resulted in loss of restriction-endonuclease sites for ncoi and styi. analysis of genomic dna revealed both a normal and an abnormal ncoi fragment, indicating that the patient was a genetic compound. ncoi and styi digestion of cdna, amplified by pcr from reverse-transcribed rna, demonstrated that greater than 95% of the gaa mrna in gm 244 was derived from the allele carrying the missense mutation. the missense mutation was uncommon, since it was not detected in 37 additional gaa-deficient chromosomes, as determined by digestion of genomic dna with ncoi and hybridization. the amino acid substitution predicts a new potential site for n-linked glycosylation, as well as major changes in secondary structure of the protein. we could confirm that the mutation was responsible for the enzyme deficiency by demonstrating that a hybrid minigene containing the mutation did not express gaa enzyme activity after transient gene expression. we have therefore now provided the first identification of a single-basepair missense mutation in a patient with pompe disease and furthermore have demonstrated that the patient is a genetic compound with the second allele barely expressing mrna.	1
duodenal carcinoma in a 37-year-old man with cowden/bannayan syndrome.  a 37-year-old man was hospitalised because of anaemia and fatigue due to an infiltrating adenocarcinoma of the treitz angle (duodenum), together with gastric, duodenal and colorectal polyps. after the operation, removal of colorectal lesions revealed the presence of ganglioneuromatosis of the large bowel. further investigations showed lack of mlh1 protein expression and microsatellite instability in the duodenal neoplasm, while the gene was normally expressed in the polyps. mlh1 sequence and multiple ligation-dependent probes amplification analysis (from constitutional dna) were normal. analysis of the pten gene revealed the presence of a constitutional mutation (c.510 t>a; p.ser170arg) which had been associated with the cowden phenotype. further detailed clinical investigations revealed macrocephaly (63 cm), melanotic spots of the penis, small angiomas, millimetric trichilemmomas in the nose and multiple lipomas, which led to the diagnosis of cowden/bannayan disease. the unusual appearance of a duodenal carcinoma as the first symptom rendered the identification of the syndrome extremely difficult.	-1
pompe disease in infants: improving the prognosis by newborn screening and early treatment.  pompe disease causes progressive, debilitating, and often life-threatening musculoskeletal, respiratory, and cardiac symptoms. favorable outcomes with early intravenous enzyme-replacement therapy and alglucosidase alfa have been reported, but early clinical diagnosis before the development of severe symptoms has rarely been possible in infants. we recently conducted a newborn screening pilot program in taiwan to improve the early detection of pompe disease. six of 206088 newborns screened tested positive and were treated for pompe disease. five had the rapidly progressive form of pompe disease, characterized by cardiac and motor involvement, and were treated soon after diagnosis. the sixth patient was started on treatment at 14 months of age because of progressive muscle weakness. outcomes were compared with treated patients whose disease was diagnosed clinically and with untreated historical control subjects. at the time of this report, patients had been treated for 14 to 32 months. the 5 infants who had early cardiac involvement demonstrated normalization of cardiac size and muscle pathology with normal physical growth and age-appropriate gains in motor development. the infant without cardiac involvement also achieved normal motor development with treatment. survival in patients who had newborn screening was significantly improved compared with those in the untreated reference cohort (p = .001). survival in the treated clinical comparators was reduced but not statistically different from that in the newborn screening group (p = .48). results from this study indicate that early treatment can benefit infants with pompe disease and highlight the advantages of early diagnosis, which can be achieved by newborn screening.	-1
a novel, de novo germline tp53 mutation in a rare presentation of the li-fraumeni syndrome in the maxilla.  we undertook the genetic analysis of a classic li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) family with clustering of primary tumours including two maxillary sarcomas, a rare lfs site of tumour occurrence. our aim was to investigate the presence of a specific type of tp53 mutation that could be associated with this unusual predilection of site for cancer occurrence. mutational screening of the coding region of tp53 revealed an a>t transversion in codon 144 of exon 5 (cag>ctg, gln>leu) in the germline of one of the three affected members, with loss of heterozygosity (loh) in the tumour tissue. all other affected members were negative for germline or somatic tp53 mutations. tp53 immunohistochemistry was uninformative. the mutation we report is a de novo constitutional tp53 mutation that has not been previously described in the literature. it could explain the more burdened phenotype of the affected patient (died at 21 months). alternative mechanisms to explain the overall family phenotype are discussed.	-1
phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in mexico: genotype-phenotype correlations, bh4 responsiveness and evidence of a founder effect.  the mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) in mexico is unknown, although it has been suggested that pku variants could have a differential geographical distribution. genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-based predictions of responsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4 ) have never been performed. we sequenced the pah gene and determined the geographic origin of each allele, mini-haplotype associated, genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-based prediction of bh4 responsiveness in 48 mexican patients. the mutational spectrum included 34 variants with c.60+5g>t being the most frequent (20.8%) and linked to haplotype 4.3 possibly because of a founder effect and/or genetic drift. two new variants were found c.1a>t and c.969+6t>c. the genotype-phenotype correlation was concordant in 70.8%. the genotype-based prediction to bh4 -responsiveness was 41.7%, this information could be useful for the rational selection of candidates for bh4 testing and therapy.	-1

structural, functional, and clinical characterization of a novel ptpn11 mutation cluster underlying noonan syndrome.  germline mutations in ptpn11, the gene encoding the src-homology 2 (sh2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (shp2), cause noonan syndrome (ns), a relatively common, clinically variable, multisystem disorder. here, we report on the identification of five different ptpn11 missense changes affecting residues leu261 , leu262 , and arg265 in 16 unrelated individuals with clinical diagnosis of ns or with features suggestive for this disorder, specifying a novel disease-causing mutation cluster. expression of the mutant proteins in hek293t cells documented their activating role on mapk signaling. structural data predicted a gain-of-function role of substitutions at residues leu262 and arg265 exerted by disruption of the n-sh2/ptp autoinhibitory interaction. molecular dynamics simulations suggested a more complex behavior for changes affecting leu261 , with possible impact on shp2's catalytic activity/selectivity and proper interaction of the ptp domain with the regulatory sh2 domains. consistent with that, biochemical data indicated that substitutions at codons 262 and 265 increased the catalytic activity of the phosphatase, while those affecting codon 261 were only moderately activating but impacted substrate specificity. remarkably, these mutations underlie a relatively mild form of ns characterized by low prevalence of cardiac defects, short stature, and cognitive and behavioral issues, as well as less evident typical facial features.	1
echocardiographic strain imaging to assess early and late consequences of sarcomere mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  genetic testing identifies sarcomere mutation carriers (g+) before clinical diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), allowing characterization of initial disease manifestations. previous studies demonstrated that impaired relaxation develops before left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). the precise impact of sarcomere mutations on systolic function in early and late disease is unclear. comprehensive echocardiography with strain imaging was performed on 146 genotyped individuals with mutations in 5 sarcomere genes. contractile parameters were compared in 68 preclinical (g+/lvh-), 40 overt (g+/lvh+) subjects with hcm, and 38 mutation (-) normal control relatives. all subjects had normal left ventricular ejection fraction. in preclinical hcm, global and regional peak systolic strain (epsilon(sys)) and longitudinal systolic strain rate were not significantly different from controls, but early diastolic mitral annular velocity (ea) was reduced by 13%. in overt hcm, there was a significant 27% and 14% decrease in global longitudinal epsilon(sys) and systolic strain rate, respectively, compared with both preclinical hcm and controls (p<0.013 for all comparisons), and a 33% reduction in ea. sarcomere mutations have disparate initial effects on diastolic and systolic functions. preclinical hcm is characterized by impaired relaxation but preserved systolic strain. in contrast, both diastolic and longitudinal systolic abnormalities are present in overt disease despite normal ejection fraction. we propose that diastolic dysfunction is an early consequence of sarcomere mutations, whereas systolic dysfunction results from mutations combined with subsequent pathological remodeling. identifying mechanistic pathways triggered by these mutations may begin to reshape the clinical paradigm for treatment, based on early diagnosis and disease prevention.	-1
clinical and genetic studies in spanish patients with usher syndrome type ii: description of new mutations and evidence for a lack of genotype--phenotype correlation.  patients with usher syndrome type ii (ush2) show moderate-to-severe hearing loss (hl), retinitis pigmentosa and normal vestibular function. the progression of hl remains controversial. to evaluate whether a phenotype-genotype correlation exists regarding the issue of progression of hl, only ush2 patients with a defined genotype were selected. ophthalmologic, vestibular and audiometric examination along with a mutation analysis of the ush2a gene (exons 1--21) was performed in twenty-eight spanish ush2 patients. ten different pathogenic mutations and 17 sequence variants not associated with the disease were found. six of the 10 mutations are novel. disease alleles were identified in 13 of the 28 families tested. eight of these 13 families had a mutation found in both alleles. in the other five families, only one mutation was identified. the phenotypic data provide evidence for the existence of phenotypic differences between patients with the same genotype. these differences were observed at both the interfamilial and intrafamilial levels.	-1
mutation analysis in a small cohort of new zealand patients originating from the united kingdom demonstrates genetic heterogeneity in familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) and familial defective apolipoprotein b-100 (fdb) are relatively common lipid disorders caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) and apolipoprotein b (apo b) genes, respectively. molecular analysis at these loci was performed in eight new zealand subjects with clinical features of heterozygous fh. utilization of an in vitro lymphocyte receptor assay demonstrated normal receptor function in four patients, three of whom screened positive for the founder-type apo b mutation, r3500q, causing fdb. four patients with reduced ldlr function, consistent with heterozygous fh, revealed three previously documented mutations in exons 3 (w66x), 6 (c292y) and 7 (g322s) of the ldlr gene and, a novel 2-bp deletion (tc or ct) after nucleotide 1204 (or 1205) in exon 9. the remaining patient was found to be fh/fdb negative after extensive mutation screening using both denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and heteroduplex-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. haplotype analysis at the ldlr and apo b loci finally excluded the likelihood that mutations in these two genes underlie the fh phenotype in the molecularly uncharacterized new zealand family originating from the united kingdom. this family represents a valuable source of material for future genetic dissection of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (adh), shown to be a heterogeneous disease through molecular analysis.	-1
detection of a large duplication mutation in the myosin-binding protein c3 gene in a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a cardiovascular disease with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric and/or regulatory proteins expressed in cardiomyocytes. in a small cohort of hcm patients (n=8), we searched for mutations in the two most common genes responsible for hcm and found four missense mutations in the myh7 gene encoding cardiac ?-myosin heavy chain (r204h, m493v, r719w, and r870h) and three mutations in the myosin-binding protein c3 gene (mybpc3) including one missense (a848v) and two frameshift mutations (c.3713deltg and c.702ins26bp). the c.702ins26bp insertion resulted from the duplication of a 26-bp fragment in a 54-year-old female hcm patient presenting with clinical signs of heart failure due to diastolic dysfunction. although such large duplications (>10 bp) in the mybpc3 gene are very rare and have been identified only in 4 families reported so far, the identical duplication mutation was found earlier in a dutch patient, demonstrating that it may constitute a hitherto unknown founder mutation in central european populations. this observation underscores the significance of insertions into the coding sequence of the mybpc3 gene for the development and pathogenesis of hcm.	-1
five new pedigrees with inherited runx1 mutations causing familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy.  familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy (fpd/aml) is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by platelet abnormalities and a predisposition to myelodysplasia (mds) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (aml). the disorder, caused by inherited mutations in runx1, is uncommon with only 14 pedigrees reported. we screened 10 families with a history of more than one first degree relative with mds/aml for inherited mutations in runx1. germ- line runx1 mutations were identified in 5 pedigrees with a 3:2 predominance of n-terminal mutations. several affected members had normal platelet counts or platelet function, features not previously reported in fpd/aml. the median incidence of mds/aml among carriers of runx1 mutation was 35%. individual treatments varied but included hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from siblings before recognition of the inherited leukemogenic mutation. transplantation was associated with a high incidence of complications including early relapse, failure of engraftment, and posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. given the small size of modern families and the clinical heterogeneity of this syndrome, the diagnosis of fpd/aml could be easily overlooked and may be more prevalent than previously recognized. therefore, it would appear prudent to screen young patients with mds/aml for runx1 mutation, before consideration of sibling hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	-1
glycogen storage disease type ii: genetic and biochemical analysis of novel mutations in infantile patients from turkish ancestry.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). this paper reports on the characterization of the molecular defects in 6 infantile patients from turkish ancestry. five of the 6 patients had reduced levels of the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor. conversion to mature enzyme was impaired in all cases, and the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase activity in all patients fibroblasts was less than 0.5% of control. dna sequence analysis revealed 3 new mutations. one mutation, found in 3 patients in homozygous form, was a double insertion in exon 19 (2471ag-->cagg) leading to a frameshift after pro 913. it is the first insertion mutation described in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene. two patients were homozygous for missense mutations leading to the substitution of ser to pro at amino acid 566 (s566p) in one case and of pro to arg at amino acid 768 (p768r) in the other. one patient was found to have a gly to arg missense mutation at amino acid 643 (g643r), previously identified in an adult patient (hermans et al., 1993), combined with a silent second allele. the latter 3 mutations were introduced in the wild type lysosomal alpha-glucosidase cdna and expressed in cos cells to analyze their effect. precursor species of 110 kd were formed but the maturation was impaired. as a result there was an overall deficiency of catalytic activity, which is in accordance with the findings in the patients fibroblasts and with the clinical phenotype.	1
phenotypical characterization of ?-galactosidase a gene mutations identified in a large fabry disease screening program in stroke in the young.  in the belgian fabry study (befas), the prevalence of fabry disease was assessed in 1000 young patients presenting with stroke, unexplained white matter lesions or vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia. the results of the befas suggested that fabry disease may play a role in up to 1% of young patients presenting with cerebrovascular disease. however, the clinical relevance was unclear in all cases. we report on detailed phenotyping in subjects identified with ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a) enzyme deficiency or gla mutations identified in the befas (n=10), and on the results of family screening in this population. family screening was performed to identify additional mutation carriers. biochemical and/or clinical evaluation of all subjects (befas index patients and relatives carrying a gla mutation) was performed. genetic family screening revealed 18 additional gla mutation carriers. bloodspot ?-gal a enzyme activity was normal in all gla mutation carriers, even in 2 males with the p.a143t mutation. plasma gb3 and lyso-gb3 levels were normal in all subjects. elevated gb3 in urine was detected in 2 subjects. some classic clinical signs of fabry disease, like angiokeratoma or cornea verticillata, could not be detected in our population. cardiac symptoms of fabry disease were found in 6 out of 10 p.a143t carriers. no signs of cerebrovascular disease were found in the relatives with a gla mutation. we could not identify mutations causing the classical clinical phenotype of fabry disease in our cerebrovascular disease population. enzyme activity analysis in bloodspots and plasma may fail to identify late-onset variants of fabry disease. we recommend genetic testing when an atypical, late-onset variant of fabry disease is suspected in a male cerebrovascular disease patient. however, this may lead to the identification of non-disease causing or controversial genetic variants.	1
cowden syndrome and bannayan riley ruvalcaba syndrome represent one condition with variable expression and age-related penetrance: results of a clinical study of pten mutation carriers.  the most commonly reported phenotypes described in patients with pten mutations are bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs), with childhood onset, macrocephaly, lipomas and developmental delay, and cowden syndrome (cs), an adult-onset condition recognised by mucocutaneous signs, with a risk of cancers, in particular those of the thyroid and breast. it has been suggested that brrs and cs are the same condition, but the literature continues to separate them and seek a genotype-phenotype correlation. to study the clinical features of patients with known pten mutations and observe any genotype-phenotype correlation. in total, 42 people (25 probands and 17 non-probands) from 26 families of all ages with pten mutations were recruited through the uk clinical genetics services. a full clinical history and examination were undertaken. we were unable to demonstrate a genotype-phenotype correlation. furthermore, our findings in a 31-year-old woman with cs and an exon 1 deletion refutes previous reports that whole exon deletions are only found in patients with a brrs phenotype. careful phenotyping gives further support for the suggestion that brrs and cs are actually one condition, presenting variably at different ages, as in other tumour-suppressor disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1. this has important counselling implications, such as advice about cancer surveillance, for children diagnosed with brrs.	-1
"extended phenotype description and new molecular findings in late onset glycogen storage disease type ii: a northern italy population study and review of the literature.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by acid alpha-1,4-glucosidase deficiency and associated with recessive mutations in its coding gene gaa. few studies have provided so far a detailed phenotypical characterization in late onset gsdii (lo-gsdii) patients. genotype-phenotype correlation has been previously attempted with controversial results. we aim to provide an in-depth description of a cohort (n = 36) of lo-gsdii patients coming from the north of italy and compare our population's findings to the literature. we performed a clinical record-based retrospective and prospective study of our patients. lo-gsdii in our cohort covers a large variability of phenotype including subtle clinical presentation and did not differ significantly from previous data. in all patients, molecular analysis disclosed gaa mutations, five of them being novel. to assess potential genotype-phenotype correlations we divided ivs1-32-13t>g heterozygous patients into two groups following the severity of the mutations on the second allele. our patients harbouring ""severe"" mutations (n = 21) presented a strong tendency to have more severe phenotypes and more disability, more severe phenotypes and more disability, higher prevalence of assisted ventilation and a shorter time of evolution to show it. the determination of prognostic factors is mandatory in order to refine the accuracy of prognostic information, to develop follow-up strategy and, more importantly, to improve the decision algorithm for enzyme replacement therapy administration. the demonstration of genotype-phenotype correlations could help to reach this objective. clinical assessment homogeneity is required to overcome limitations due to the lack of power of most studies."	-1
adult-onset glycogen storage disease type ii: phenotypic and allelic heterogeneity in german patients.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii, pompe's disease) is an autosomal recessive inherited deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (gaa). clinical as well as biochemical and allelic heterogeneity have been described in gsdii. we identified mutations within the gaa gene in seven unrelated german patients, six with adult- and one with juvenile-onset gsdii. beside previously described mutations [ivs1 (-13t --> g), delta(exon) 18, c1634t], we characterized four new mutations of gsdii: ivs6 (-22t --> g), 271delg, g1912t (gly638trp), and 2432insc. the ivs6 (-22t --> g) mutation gives rise to aberrant splicing, causing inframe deletions of 25 or 40 amino acids within the gaa coding sequence and the insertion of a sequence of seven missense amino acids. two affected siblings and an unrelated patient with adult gsdii are apparently homozygous for the exon 18 deletion. both siblings are also heteroallelic for ivs1 (-13t --> g). in conclusion, we observed pronounced allelic heterogeneity and an unexpectedly high frequency of homozygosity for larger in-frame deletions within the gaa coding sequence in german adult-onset gsdii patients.	1
accurate molecular diagnosis of phenylketonuria and tetrahydrobiopterin-deficient hyperphenylalaninemias using high-throughput targeted sequencing.  genetic diagnostics of phenylketonuria (pku) and tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) deficient hyperphenylalaninemia (bh4dh) rely on methods that scan for known mutations or on laborious molecular tools that use sanger sequencing. we have implemented a novel and much more efficient strategy based on high-throughput multiplex-targeted resequencing of four genes (pah, gch1, pts, and qdpr) that, when affected by loss-of-function mutations, cause pku and bh4dh. we have validated this approach in a cohort of 95 samples with the previously known pah, gch1, pts, and qdpr mutations and one control sample. pooled barcoded dna libraries were enriched using a custom nimblegen seqcap ez choice array and sequenced using a hiseq2000 sequencer. the combination of several robust bioinformatics tools allowed us to detect all known pathogenic mutations (point mutations, short insertions/deletions, and large genomic rearrangements) in the 95 samples, without detecting spurious calls in these genes in the control sample. we then used the same capture assay in a discovery cohort of 11 uncharacterized hpa patients using a miseq sequencer. in addition, we report the precise characterization of the breakpoints of four genomic rearrangements in pah, including a novel deletion of 899 bp in intron 3. our study is a proof-of-principle that high-throughput-targeted resequencing is ready to substitute classical molecular methods to perform differential genetic diagnosis of hyperphenylalaninemias, allowing the establishment of specifically tailored treatments a few days after birth.	-1
deamidations in recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase. identification of labile asparagine residues and functional characterization of asn --> asp mutant forms.  recombinant human phenylalanine hydroxylase (hpah) expressed in escherichia coli for 24 h at 28 degrees c has been found by two-dimensional electrophoresis to exist as a mixture of four to five molecular forms as a result of nonenzymatic deamidation of labile asn residues. the multiple deamidations alter the functional properties of the enzyme including its affinity for l-phenylalanine and tetrahydrobiopterin, catalytic efficiency, and substrate inhibition and also result in enzyme forms more susceptible to limited tryptic proteolysis. asn(32) in the regulatory domain deamidates very rapidly because of its nearest neighbor amino acid gly(33) (solstad, t., carvalho, r. n., andersen, o. a., waidelich, d., and flatmark, t. (2003) eur. j. biochem., in press). matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight-mass spectrometry of the tryptic peptides in the catalytic domain of a 24-h (28 degrees c) expressed enzyme has shown asn(376) and asn(133) to be labile residues. site-directed mutagenesis of nine asn residues revealed that the deamidations of asn(32) and asn(376) are the main determinants for the functional and regulatory differences observed between the 2- and 24-h-induced wild-type (wt) enzyme. the asn(32) --> asp, asn(376) --> asp, and the double mutant forms expressed for 2 h at 28 degrees c revealed qualitatively similar regulatory properties as the highly deamidated 24-h expressed wt-hpah. moreover, deamidation of asn(32) in the wt-hpah (24 h expression at 28 degrees c) and the asn(32) --> asp mutation both increase the initial rate of phosphorylation of ser(16) by camp-dependent protein kinase (p < 0.005). by contrast, the substitution of gly(33) with ala or val, both preventing the deamidation of asn(32), resulted in enzyme forms that were phosphorylated at a similar rate as nondeamidated wt-hpah, even on 24-h expression. the other asn --> asp substitutions (in the catalytic domain) revealed that asn(207) and asn(223) have an important stabilizing structural function. finally, two recently reported phenylketonuria mutations at asn residues in the catalytic domain were studied, i.e. asn(167) --> ile and asn(207) --> asp, and their phenotypes were characterized.	1
the prevalent deep intronic c. 639+919 g>a gla mutation causes pseudoexon activation and fabry disease by abolishing the binding of hnrnpa1 and hnrnp a2/b1 to a splicing silencer.  fabry disease is an x-linked recessive inborn disorder of the glycosphingolipid metabolism, caused by total or partial deficiency of the lysosomal ?-galactosidase a enzyme due to mutations in the gla gene. the prevalent c.639+919 g>a mutation in gla leads to pathogenic insertion of a 57bp pseudoexon sequence from intron 4, which is responsible for the cardiac variant phenotype. in this study we investigate the splicing regulatory mechanism leading to gla pseudoexon activation. splicing analysis of gla minigenes revealed that pseudoexon activation is influenced by cell-type. we demonstrate that the wild-type sequence harbors an hnrnp a1 and hnrnp a2/b1-binding exonic splicing silencer (ess) overlapping the 5'splice site (5'ss) that prevents pseudoexon inclusion. the c.639+919 g>a mutation disrupts this ess allowing u1 snrnp recognition of the 5'ss. we show that the wild-type gla 5'ss motif with the ess is also able to inhibit inclusion of an unrelated pseudoexon in the fgb gene, and that also in the fgb context inactivation of the ess by the c.639+919 g>a mutation causes pseudoexon activation, underscoring the universal nature of the ess. finally, we demonstrate that splice switching oligonucleotide (sso) mediated blocking of the pseudoexon 3'ss and 5'ss effectively restores normal gla splicing. this indicates that sso based splicing correction may be a therapeutic alternative in the treatment of fabry disease.	1

late onset pompe disease: clinical and neurophysiological spectrum of 38 patients including long-term follow-up in 18 patients.  to describe the clinical and neurophysiological spectrum and prognosis in a large cohort of biochemically and genetically proven late onset pompe patients. thirty-eight diagnosed with late onset pompe disease at our neuromuscular department during 1985 and 2006 are described in detail. the mean delay from onset of symptoms or first medical consultation until diagnosis was 10.4 and 7.1 years, respectively. a different diagnosis was suggested in 11 of 38 patients. ten patients underwent repeated muscle biopsies before diagnosis of pompe disease was established. limb girdle weakness was the most frequent presenting sign. six patients complained of myalgia. wolf-parkinson-white syndrome was found in 3 of 38 patients. respiratory failure preceded the onset of overt limb muscle weakness in three patients. the course of the patients was progressive in all, but there was a wide variety of progression, which did not correlate with the age of disease onset. in 71% of the patients, neurophysiological investigations revealed a myopathic emg pattern, half of the patients had spontaneous activity including complex repetitive discharges. a normal emg was found in 9% of the patients. nerve conduction studies were normal in all. pompe disease should be taken into consideration in patients with unexplained limb girdle muscular weakness with respiratory failure. cardiac manifestations may not be restricted to infantile pompe disease.	-1
influence of pah genotype on sapropterin response in pku: results of a single-center cohort study.  identifying phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) mutations associated with sapropterin response in phenylketonuria (pku) would be an advantageous means to determine clinical benefit to sapropterin therapy. sapropterin response, defined as a ?30 % reduction in phenylalanine (phe) levels after a dose of 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin for week one and 20 mg/kg/day for week two in 112 pku patients aged 4-45 years, was assessed in an outpatient setting. pah was sequenced in all patients. mutations were correlated with sapropterin response. dietary phe intake was increased over a 6-week period in responsive patients. forty-six of 112 patients were sapropterin responsive. genotypes p.[l48s];[l48s] and p.[y414c];[y414c] were always associated with response at a low dose. the mutation y414c (present on 16 alleles) was most frequently associated with response. patients with presence of the mutation l48s on at least one allele (12 alleles in 7 patients) always showed response to sapropterin. responsive patients had a mean phe tolerance increase of 189 % (range 11-742 %). in the 66 nonresponders, mutations r408w (38 alleles) and ivs12+1g>a (18 alleles) were detected most frequently. genotypes [ivs12+1g>a];[ivs12+1g>a], p.[l348v];[r408w], p.[p281l];[p281l], p.[r158q];[r408w], and p.[r261q];[r408w] were always associated with nonresponse. data from the study contributes to growing evidence of the relationship between pah genotype and pku phenotype. in most cases, response to sapropterin therapy cannot be predicted based on the presence of a single mutation on one allele alone, although the complete pah genotype may help to predict sapropterin responsiveness in pku patients.	-1
"molecular and phenotypic effects of heterozygous, homozygous, and compound heterozygote myosin heavy-chain mutations.  autosomal dominant familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) has variable penetrance and phenotype. heterozygous mutations in myh7 encoding beta-myosin heavy chain are the most common causes of fhc, and we proposed that ""enhanced"" mutant actin-myosin function is the causative molecular abnormality. we have studied individuals from families in which members have two, one, or no mutant myh7 alleles to examine for dose effects. in one family, a member homozygous for lys207gln had cardiomyopathy complicated by left ventricular dilatation, systolic impairment, atrial fibrillation, and defibrillator interventions. only one of five heterozygous relatives had fhc. leu908val and asp906gly mutations were detected in a second family in which penetrance for leu908val heterozygotes was 46% (21/46) and 25% (3/12) for asp906gly. despite the low penetrance, hypertrophy was severe in several heterozygotes. two individuals with both mutations developed severe fhc. the velocities of actin translocation (v(actin)) by mutant and wild-type (wt) myosins were compared in the in vitro motility assay. compared with wt/wt, v(actin) was 34% faster for wt/d906g and 21% for wt/l908v. surprisingly v(actin) for leu908val/asp906gly and lys207gln/lys207gln mutants were similar to wt. the apparent enhancement of mechanical performance with mutant/wt myosin was not observed for mutant/mutant myosin. this suggests that v(actin) may be a poor predictor of disease penetrance or severity and that power production may be more appropriate, or that the limited availability of double mutant patients prohibits any definitive conclusions. finally, severe fhc in heterozygous individuals can occur despite very low penetrance, suggesting these mutations alone are insufficient to cause fhc and that uncharacterized modifying mechanisms exert powerful influences."	-1
a mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  a mouse model of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) was generated by the introduction of an arg 403 --> gln mutation into the alpha cardiac myosin heavy chain (mhc) gene. homozygous alpha mhc 403/403 mice died 7 days after birth, and sedentary heterozygous alpha mhc 403/+ mice survived for 1 year. cardiac histopathology and dysfunction in the alpha mhc 403/+ mice resembled human fhc. cardiac dysfunction preceded histopathologic changes, and myocyte disarray, hypertrophy, and fibrosis increased with age. young male alpha mhc 403/+ mice showed more evidence of disease than did their female counterparts. preliminary results suggested that exercise capacity may have been compromised in the alpha mhc 403/+ mice. this mouse model may help to define the natural history of fhc.	1
brca1, brca2 and tp53 mutations in very early-onset breast cancer with associated risks to relatives.  pathological mutations in brca1, brca2 and tp53 are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. this study evaluated mutation frequency of these genes in early-onset breast cancer patients, and correlated this with family history and determined relative risks to family members. patients with breast adenocarcinoma diagnosed 30 years were ascertained between 1980 and 1997. family history was established and mutation screening of brca1, brca2 and tp53 genes was performed. estimates of penetrance and relative risk were undertaken. dna was obtained from 100/139 women. 17/36 familial cases had a brca1, brca2 or tp53 mutation. of 64 non-familial cases, one brca2, two brca1 and two tp53 mutations were detected. penetrance estimates (by age 70) for breast cancer were 84% for brca1 mutations and 91% for brca2 mutations and for ovarian cancer, 60% and 26%, respectively. relative risks associated with mutations were consistent with previous studies. brca1 and brca2 mutations in patients with breast cancer 30 years are predicted strongly by family history. the majority of families with ovarian cancer were due to mutations in brca1/2 whereas these mutations only accounted for 30-50% of the excess breast cancers.	-1
a cysteine-for-arginine substitution (r614c) in the human skeletal muscle calcium release channel cosegregates with malignant hyperthermia.  a point mutation in the human gene for the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (ryanodine receptor [ryr1]) correlates with inheritance of malignant hyperthermia in a family of northern european descent. the substitution of thymine for cytosine at position 1840 of the ryr1 transcript results in a cysteine-for-arginine substitution at position 614 (r614c) of the amino acid sequence. the mutation was absent in 59 normal individuals from the general population, in 61 additional unrelated malignant hyperthermia-susceptible patients, and in 18 patients with malignant hyperthermia associated with other inherited or congenital diseases. together with reports of an equivalent mutation in six susceptible pig strains and an identical mutation in one other human pedigree, these findings suggest that the cysteine-for-arginine mutation represents a shared calcium release channel pathogenesis between porcine malignant hyperthermia and a subset of mutations responsible for the human malignant hyperthermia syndrome.	-1
"familial hypercholesterolemia in china. identification of mutations in the ldl-receptor gene that result in a receptor-negative phenotype.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh), caused by many different mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-receptor gene, invariably leads to severe premature coronary heart disease (chd) in homozygous individuals. heterozygous fh patients are less severely affected but are still at increased risk of chd in most populations. although fh homozygotes in china are affected similarly to those elsewhere, heterozygotes are not detected in the general population and obligate heterozygotes are often not hypercholesterolemic by western standards. mutations in the ldl-receptor genes of 10 homozygous fh patients from the jiang-su province of china and their heterozygous parents were analyzed. these include one large and two minor deletions and eight point mutations: four are predicted to introduce a premature stop codon, five to result in a single amino acid substitution or deletion, and one to produce a protein with an abnormal cytoplasmic tail. expression of the mutant ldl-receptor cdnas in vitro confirmed that these mutations impaired ldl-receptor function and that several would cause a receptor-negative phenotype. thus, the lack of clinical expression in obligate fh heterozygotes is not due to unusually ""mild"" mutations in the ldl-receptor gene, and other genetic or environmental factors must therefore be important in determining phenotypic expression."	1
cdh1 associated gastric cancer: a report of a family and review of the literature.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is an autosomal-dominant inherited form of gastric cancer associated with inactivating germline mutations in the cdh1 gene. we set out to outline the role of cdh1 in hdgc. investigation of a family suspected as having hdgc is discussed. the role of surgery in the management of affected individuals is then examined. a search was conducted of medline and the national library of medicine to identify key articles concerning cdh1 gene mutations, familial gastric cancer and gastrectomy. further, relevant articles were obtained by manual scanning of the reference lists of identified papers. mutation-specific cdh1 genetic testing was performed on six living family members and on gastric tissue obtained from two deceased members. cdh1 mutations cause inactivation of the cell adhesion protein e-cadherin. carriers of the cdh1 germline gene mutation develop an aggressive, diffuse, submucosal gastric cancer at an early age. current endoscopic screening is ineffective at detecting hdgc. the presence of a cdh1 germline gene mutation was confirmed in both deceased family members and also in four of the six living members tested. genetic counselling and cdh1 gene mutation testing is indicated in families with suspected hdgc. in the absence of a satisfactory surveillance mechanism, prophylactic total gastrectomy would appear to be an appropriate therapeutic option in mutation carriers.	-1
pregnancy in homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia--importance of ldl-apheresis.  rare cases of pregnancy in women with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hfh) have been reported. hfh might pose significant risks for the mother and her fetus. statins, the most potent agents for low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol reduction, are contraindicated; thus lipoprotein apheresis remains the only effective treatment. we report on a 34-year-old pregnant woman with hfh who was treated throughout the entire pregnancy by lipoprotein apheresis (immunoadsorption method). increasing levels of ldl-cholesterol were stabilized at 9-10 mmol/l by lipoprotein apheresis (performed every 10 days). no complications were observed during the treatment procedures. monitoring of the fetus revealed no impairment of the umbilical cord and blood flow in the uterine arteries, as well as no intrauterine growth retardation. the delivery was spontaneous and the child was breastfed for two months. intensive treatment by lipoprotein apheresis is an effective and safe therapeutic strategy during pregnancy, even in severe cases of hfh, as it can stabilize progressively increasing lipoprotein levels and prevent severe complications.	-1
prevalence and spectrum of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations among patients with early-onset colorectal cancer.  hereditary cancer syndromes infer high cancer risks and require intensive cancer surveillance, yet the prevalence and spectrum of these conditions among unselected patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (crc) is largely undetermined. to determine the frequency and spectrum of cancer susceptibility gene mutations among patients with early-onset crc. overall, 450 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer younger than 50 years were prospectively accrued from 51 hospitals into the ohio colorectal cancer prevention initiative from january 1, 2013, to june 20, 2016. mismatch repair (mmr) deficiency was determined by microsatellite instability and/or immunohistochemistry. germline dna was tested for mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes using next-generation sequencing. mutation prevalence and spectrum in patients with early-onset crc was determined. clinical characteristics were assessed by mutation status. in total 450 patients younger than 50 years were included in the study, and 75 gene mutations were found in 72 patients (16%). forty-eight patients (10.7%) had mmr-deficient tumors, and 40 patients (83.3%) had at least 1 gene mutation: 37 had lynch syndrome (13, mlh1 [including one with constitutional mlh1 methylation]; 16, msh2; 1, msh2/monoallelic mutyh; 2, msh6; 5, pms2); 1 patient had the apc c.3920t>a, p.i1307k mutation and a pms2 variant; 9 patients (18.8%) had double somatic mmr mutations (including 2 with germline biallelic mutyh mutations); and 1 patient had somatic mlh1 methylation. four hundred two patients (89.3%) had mmr-proficient tumors, and 32 patients (8%) had at least 1 gene mutation: 9 had mutations in high-penetrance crc genes (5, apc; 1, apc/pms2; 2, biallelic mutyh; 1, smad4); 13 patients had mutations in high- or moderate-penetrance genes not traditionally associated with crc (3, atm; 1, atm/chek2; 2, brca1; 4, brca2; 1, cdkn2a; 2, palb2); 10 patients had mutations in low-penetrance crc genes (3, apc c.3920t>a, p.i1307k; 7, monoallelic mutyh). importantly, 24 of 72 patients (33.3%) who were mutation positive did not meet established genetic testing criteria for the gene(s) in which they had a mutation. of 450 patients with early-onset crc, 72 (16%) had gene mutations. given the high frequency and wide spectrum of mutations, genetic counseling and testing with a multigene panel could be considered for all patients with early-onset crc.	-1
p53 mosaicism with an exon 8 germline mutation in the founder of a cancer-prone pedigree.  changes in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 are frequently acquired during the course of malignant development of human tumors. recently, constitutional heterozygous mutations in p53 exon 7 have been identified as the primary cause of cancer predisposition in cases of the familial li-fraumeni cancer syndrome. these findings underline the need for extensive mutation screening in families with high cancer incidence. this report describes the detection and follow-up by two-dimensional single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis (2dsscp) of a new germline mutation of p53 exon 8 in a case of suspected li-fraumeni syndrome. although a high cancer incidence had been reported in the family history of the father of siblings suffering from brain tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma, a constitutional heterozygous p53 mutation was identified only in the affected children. retrospective analysis of archival tissue of a half-sister who died several years ago from a tumor of previously uncertain diagnosis revealed the same mutation. the mutation had therefore occurred in the germ cells of the mother, who thus appears to be a mosaic. the cancer predisposition of the paternal ancestors must have been due to other factors.	-1
a transforming met mutation discovered in non-small cell lung cancer using microarray-based resequencing.  we have designed resequencing microarrays to test the performance of this platform when interrogating a large number of exons (164 total) from genes associated with cancer. to evaluate false positive and negative rates, dideoxy sequencing was done for 335,420 bases interrogated by the arrays. from the array data, calls could be made for approximately 97.5% of the bases, and false positive rates were very low with only a single mutation reported from the array dataset for which the corresponding dideoxy trace had a clean wildtype sequence. for the nucleotide positions where array calls were made, false negative rates were 1.41% for heterozygous mutations. all the homozygous mutations were detected, but 8.11% were erroneously reported as heterozygous changes from the reference sequence by the array analysis software. in addition, 20 non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) samples were analyzed using the arrays, and both somatic and germline mutations were found. the most interesting findings were two met mutations that have recently been implemented in nsclc. large scale maldi-tof genotyping indicated that one of these mutations (t1010i) might represent a true cancer-causing genotype, whereas the other (n375s) appears to be a common germline polymorphism.	-1
germline mutations in predisposition genes in pediatric cancer.  the prevalence and spectrum of predisposing mutations among children and adolescents with cancer are largely unknown. knowledge of such mutations may improve the understanding of tumorigenesis, direct patient care, and enable genetic counseling of patients and families. in 1120 patients younger than 20 years of age, we sequenced the whole genomes (in 595 patients), whole exomes (in 456), or both (in 69). we analyzed the dna sequences of 565 genes, including 60 that have been associated with autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes, for the presence of germline mutations. the pathogenicity of the mutations was determined by a panel of medical experts with the use of cancer-specific and locus-specific genetic databases, the medical literature, computational predictions, and second hits identified in the tumor genome. the same approach was used to analyze data from 966 persons who did not have known cancer in the 1000 genomes project, and a similar approach was used to analyze data from an autism study (from 515 persons with autism and 208 persons without autism). mutations that were deemed to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic were identified in 95 patients with cancer (8.5%), as compared with 1.1% of the persons in the 1000 genomes project and 0.6% of the participants in the autism study. the most commonly mutated genes in the affected patients were tp53 (in 50 patients), apc (in 6), brca2 (in 6), nf1 (in 4), pms2 (in 4), rb1 (in 3), and runx1 (in 3). a total of 18 additional patients had protein-truncating mutations in tumor-suppressor genes. of the 58 patients with a predisposing mutation and available information on family history, 23 (40%) had a family history of cancer. germline mutations in cancer-predisposing genes were identified in 8.5% of the children and adolescents with cancer. family history did not predict the presence of an underlying predisposition syndrome in most patients.

"a pharmacogenetic approach to identify mutant forms of ?-galactosidase a that respond to a pharmacological chaperone for fabry disease.  fabry disease is caused by mutations in the gene (gla) that encodes ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a). the iminosugar at1001 (gr181413a, migalastat hydrochloride, 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) is a pharmacological chaperone that selectively binds and stabilizes ?-gal a, increasing total cellular levels and activity for some mutant forms (defined as ""responsive""). in this study, we developed a cell-based assay in cultured hek-293 cells to identify mutant forms of ?-gal a that are responsive to at1001. concentration-dependent increases in ?-gal a activity in response to at1001 were shown for 49 (60%) of 81 mutant forms. the responses of ?-gal a mutant forms were generally consistent with the responses observed in male fabry patient-derived lymphoblasts. importantly, the hek-293 cell responses of 19 ?-gal a mutant forms to a clinically achievable concentration of at1001 (10 m) were generally consistent with observed increases in ?-gal a activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from male fabry patients orally administered at1001 during phase 2 clinical studies. this indicates that the cell-based responses can identify mutant forms of ?-gal a that are likely to respond to at1001 in vivo. thus, the hek-293 cell-based assay may be a useful aid in the identification of fabry patients with at1001-responsive mutant forms."	1

hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: translation of cdh1 germline mutations into clinical practice.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is the only known cancer syndrome that is dominated by gastric adenocarcinoma. hdgc is caused by germline mutation of the cdh1 gene that encodes the cell adhesion protein e-cadherin. mutation carriers have a more than 70% lifetime risk of developing dgc and an elevated risk of lobular breast cancer. intestinal-type gastric cancer is not part of the syndrome. clinical management of hdgc involves predictive genetic testing beginning at or near 16 years of age. it is recommended that mutation carriers undergo prophylactic gastrectomy after about 20 years of age. anatomical mapping has demonstrated that mutation carriers develop multifocal stage t1a signet ring cell carcinomas, with up to several hundred foci being observed in single stomachs. these foci develop following the somatic inactivation of the second cdh1 allele by mechanisms that include dna promoter hypermethylation.	-1
pten c.511c>t nonsense mutation in a brrs family disrupts a potential exonic splicing enhancer and causes exon skipping.  bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by macrocephaly, intestinal hamartomatous polyps, lipomas and pigmented macules of the glans penis. we identified a thai family affected with brrs. in addition to typical manifestations of brrs, the proband has a large hepatic avm which is rarely found in brrs. the molecular analysis revealed affected members were heterozygous for an exon skipping-associated nonsense mutation c.511c>t in the pten gene. the mutation was previously assumed to be deleterious by causing a change to a termination codon, q171x. we, herein, found that another pathogenic effect was splicing related by disrupting a potential exonic splicing enhancer (ese) and causing an entire exon 6 skipping. the results prompted us to investigate other reported missense/nonsense mutations in the pten gene. we found that they do not colocalize with ese sites, suggesting that most of their pathogenic effects are not through ese disruption.	1
[analysis for phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in 35 ethnic hui children from ningxia with phenylketonuria].  to determine the type and frequency of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) mutations in ethnic hui patients from ningxia with phenylketonuria (pku). for 35 pku children patients and 50 healthy individuals, all exons and promoters of the pah gene were analyzed with pcr and direct sequencing. twenty mutations, including 8 missense mutations (40%), 5 nonsense mutations (25%), 4 splice site mutations (20%) and 3 deletion mutants (15%) were discovered. the overall detection rate was 68.57% (48/70). common mutations have included r243q (12.86%), r241c (11.43%), ex6-96a to g (5.71%), y356x (5.71%), r413p(4.29%) and q232x(4.29%), whilst rarer ones have included s16fsx10 (2.86%), r111x (2.86%) and l430p (2.86%). among these, s16fsx10, l430p, d222g and ivs11+ 1g to a have not been reported previously. y414x and s303fsx38 have not been reported in hui ethnic group. no mutation was detected in the 50 normal controls. the types and distribution of pah gene mutations in ethnic hui from ningxia have been different from other areas of china. the mutations also showed a rich diversity.	-1
the phenylalanine hydroxylase c.30c>g synonymous variation (p.g10g) creates a common exonic splicing silencer.  pku is caused by mutations in pah. a c.30c>g synonymous variation in exon 1, previously reported as neutral, was observed in two patients. the variation creates a ggg triplet, which is part of several exonic splicing silencer (ess) motifs. because the 5'-splice site of pah exon 1 is intrinsically weak and therefore could be responsive to a new flanking ess, we hypothesized that c.30c>g could cause aberrant mrna splicing. we demonstrate that c.30c>g causes aberrant mrna splicing in two different reporter minigenes, and that this is abolished if a preexisting flanking ggg triplet is disrupted. ggg triplets are part of the consensus motif bound by splicing-inhibitory hnrnph proteins and we observed a dramatic increase in hnrnph binding to c.30c>g pah rna. we conclude that c.30c>g creates a hnrnph-binding ess, which can disrupt mrna splicing. a disease-causing mutation in hexb, which has previously been associated with exon skipping in patients also creates a ggg triplet. we show that the mutant hexb motif causes exon skipping of a reporter minigene and that this is also influenced by a flanking ggg triplet. we suggest that aberrant splicing caused by creation/abolishment of ggg triplets located together with a preexisting flanking ggg triplet, may be an underreported cause of human disease. it is important to recognize that exonic sequence changes may disrupt mrna splicing. this is particularly important in pah, since pku patients harboring such mutations are unlikely to respond to therapy with 6r-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)), despite the fact that the genetic code indicates otherwise.	1
myocardial fibrosis as the first sign of cardiac involvement in a male patient with fabry disease: report of a clinical case and discussion on the utility of the magnetic resonance in fabry pathology.  cardiovascular magnetic resonance (cmr) with late gadolinium enhancement (lge) imaging is increasingly used to assess myocardial involvement in patients with fabry disease, an x linked lipid storage disorder. however, it is often proposed as an optional tool. a different cardiomyopathic disease progression between male and female patients was hypothesised in previous studies, as in female myocardial fibrosis was found without left ventricular (lv) hypertrophy, while myocardial fibrosis was always detected in association to lv hypertrophy in men. a male caucasian patient, 19 years old, diagnosed through a family-based molecular screening, presented with lge of the lv inferolateral wall evidenced at the cmr, without lv hypertrophy, or other clinical signs of the disease. this is the first report of cardiac fibrosis as the first sign of organ involvement in a male patient with fabry disease. this finding stresses the importance of performing cmr with lge imaging for the initial staging and monitoring of fabry patients of both genders.	-1
identification of the first deletion-insertion involving the complete structure of gaa gene and part of ccdc40 gene mediated by an alu element.  pompe disease is an uncommon autosomal recessive glycogen storage disorder caused by deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase. classic infantile form triggers severe cardiomyopathy, hypotonia, and respiratory failure, leading to death within the first two years of life. the majority of patients with pompe disease have been reported to have point mutations in the gaa gene. we report the first complex deletion-insertion encompassing the complete structure of gaa gene and a large fragment of the gene ccdc40 in a patient with very severe form of pompe disease. sequencing analysis of breakpoints allowed us to determine the potential implication of an alu repeat in the pathogenic mechanism. we suggest that molecular strategy of pompe disease should include systematic analysis of large rearrangements.	-1
auditory system involvement in late onset pompe disease: a study of 20 italian patients.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsd ii), also known as pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by a reduced activity of acid alpha glucosidase (gaa). two different clinical entities have been described: rapidly fatal infantile and late onset forms. hearing loss has been described in classic infantile pompe patients but rarely in late onset cases. the main purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of the auditory system in a cohort of italian patients with late onset gsd ii. we have enrolled 20 patients, 12 males and 8 females. the auditory system assessment included speech and pure tone audiometry, impedance audiometry and auditory brainstem responses (abr). a combined interpretation of those tests allowed us to define the origin of the hearing impairment (sensorineural, conductive or mixed). clinically, all patients but one denied subjective hearing disturbances. on the other hand, audiological evaluation revealed that 21/40 patient ears (52.5%) had a hearing impairment: 57% had a sensorineural deficit, 33% showed a conductive hearing loss whereas 10% presented with a mixed pattern. our study revealed that, in this group of gsdii late onset patients, the auditory system impairment was more frequently present than thought with a prominent cochlear involvement. our results emphasize the importance of a routinely auditory function evaluation in all forms of pompe disease.	-1
genetic complexity in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy revealed by high-throughput sequencing.  clinical interpretation of the large number of rare variants identified by high throughput sequencing (hts) technologies is challenging. the aim of this study was to explore the clinical implications of a hts strategy for patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) using a targeted hts methodology and workflow developed for patients with a range of inherited cardiovascular diseases. by comparing the sequencing results with published findings and with sequence data from a large-scale exome sequencing screen of uk individuals, we sought to quantify the strength of the evidence supporting causality for detected candidate variants. 223 unrelated patients with hcm (4615 years at diagnosis, 74% males) were studied. in order to analyse coding, intronic and regulatory regions of 41 cardiovascular genes, we used solution-based sequence capture followed by massive parallel resequencing on illumina gaiix. average read-depth in the 2.1 mb target region was 120. rare (frequency<0.5%) non-synonymous, loss-of-function and splice-site variants were defined as candidates. excluding titin, we identified 152 distinct candidate variants in sarcomeric or associated genes (89 novel) in 143 patients (64%). four sarcomeric genes (myh7, mybpc3, tnni3, tnnt2) showed an excess of rare single non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) in cases compared to controls. the estimated probability that a nssnp in these genes is pathogenic varied between 57% and near certainty depending on the location. we detected an additional 94 candidate variants (73 novel) in desmosomal, and ion-channel genes in 96 patients (43%). this study provides the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the prevalence of sarcomere protein gene variants in patients with hcm using hts technology. inclusion of other genes implicated in inherited cardiac disease identifies a large number of non-synonymous rare variants of unknown clinical significance.	-1
mutations in sdccag8/nphp10 cause bardet-biedl syndrome and are associated with penetrant renal disease and absent polydactyly.  the ciliopathies are an expanding group of disorders caused by mutations in genes implicated in the biogenesis and function of primary cilia. bardet-biedl syndrome (bbs) is a model ciliopathy characterized by progressive retinal degeneration, obesity, polydactyly, cognitive impairment, kidney anomalies and hypogonadism. mutations in sdccag8(nphp10) were described recently in patients with nephronophthisis and retinal degeneration (senior-loken syndrome; sls). given the phenotypic and genetic overlap between known ciliopathy genes, we hypothesized that mutations in sdccag8 might also contribute alleles to more severe, multisystemic ciliopathies. we performed genetic and phenotypic analyses of 2 independent bbs cohorts. subsequent to mutation screening, we made a detailed phenotypic analysis of 5 families mutated for sdccag8 (3 homozygous and 2 compound heterozygous mutations) and conducted statistical analyses across both cohorts to examine possible phenotype-genotype correlations with mutations at this locus. all patients with mutations in sdccag8 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for bbs (retinal degeneration, obesity, cognitive defects, renal failure, hypogonadism). interestingly, none of the patients with primary sdccag8 mutations had polydactyly, a frequent but not obligatory bbs feature. in contrast, the same patients displayed early-onset renal failure, obesity, as well as recurrent pulmonary and ent infections. comparison of the phenotypes of these families with our entire bbs cohort indicated that renal impairment and absent polydactyly correlated significantly with causal sdccag8 mutations. thus, sdccag8 mutations are sufficient to cause bbs in 1-2% of our combined cohorts, and define this gene as the sixteenth bbs locus (bbs16). the absence of polydactyly and the concomitant, apparently fully penetrant association with early kidney failure represents the first significant genotype-phenotype correlation in bbs that potentially represents an indicator for phenotype-driven priority screening and informs specific patient management.	-1
the e1784k mutation in scn5a is associated with mixed clinical phenotype of type 3 long qt syndrome.  phenotypic overlap of type 3 long qt syndrome (lqt3) with brugada syndrome (brs) is observed in some carriers of mutations in the na channel scn5a. while this overlap is important for patient management, the clinical features, prevalence, and mechanisms underlying such overlap have not been fully elucidated. to investigate the basis for this overlap, we genotyped a cohort of 44 lqt3 families of multiple ethnicities from 7 referral centers and found a high prevalence of the e1784k mutation in scn5a. of 41 e1784k carriers, 93% had lqt3, 22% had brs, and 39% had sinus node dysfunction. heterologously expressed e1784k channels showed a 15.0-mv negative shift in the voltage dependence of na channel inactivation and a 7.5-fold increase in flecainide affinity for resting-state channels, properties also seen with other lqt3 mutations associated with a mixed clinical phenotype. furthermore, these properties were absent in na channels harboring the t1304m mutation, which is associated with lqt3 without a mixed clinical phenotype. these results suggest that a negative shift of steady-state na channel inactivation and enhanced tonic block by class ic drugs represent common biophysical mechanisms underlying the phenotypic overlap of lqt3 and brs and further indicate that class ic drugs should be avoided in patients with na channels displaying these behaviors.	1
mutation profile of all 49 exons of the human myosin viia gene, and haplotype analysis, in usher 1b families from diverse origins.  usher syndrome types i (ush1a-ush1e) are a group of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by profound congenital hearing loss, vestibular areflexia, and progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa. the human myosin viia gene, located on 11q14, has been shown to be responsible for usher syndrome type 1b (ush1b). haplotypes were constructed in 28 ush1 families by use of the following polymorphic markers spanning the ush1b locus: d11s787, d11s527, d11s1789, d11s906, d11s4186, and omp. affected individuals and members of their families from 12 different ethnic origins were screened for the presence of mutations in all 49 exons of the myosin viia gene. in 15 families myosin viia mutations were detected, verifying their classification as ush1b. all these mutations are novel, including three missense mutations, one premature stop codon, two splicing mutations, one frameshift, and one deletion of >2 kb comprising exons 47 and 48, a part of exon 49, and the introns between them. three mutations were shared by more than one family, consistent with haplotype similarities. altogether, 16 ush1b haplotypes were observed in the 15 families; most haplotypes were population specific. several exonic and intronic polymorphisms were also detected. none of the 20 known ush1b mutations reported so far in other world populations were identified in our families.	-1
tumor genome analysis includes germline genome: are we ready for surprises?  we sought to describe the spectrum of potential and confirmed germline genomic events incidentally identified during routine medium-throughput somatic tumor dna sequencing, and to provide a framework for pre- and post-test consent and counseling for patients and families. targeted tumor-only next-generation sequencing (ngs) had been used to evaluate for possible druggable genomic events obtained from consecutive new patients with metastatic gastroesophageal, hepatobiliary or colorectal cancer seen at the university of chicago. a panel of medical oncologists, cancer geneticists and genetic counselors retrospectively grouped these patients (n = 111) based on probability of possessing a potentially inherited mutation in a cancer susceptibility gene, both prior to and after incorporating tumor-only ngs results. high-risk patients (determined from ngs results) were contacted and counseled in person by a genetic counselor (n = 21). when possible and indicated, germline genetic testing was offered. of 8 evaluable high-risk patients, 7 underwent germline testing. three (37.5%) had confirmed actionable germline mutations (all in the brca2 gene). ngs offers promise, but poses significant challenges for oncologists who are ill prepared to handle incidental findings that have clinical implications for at risk family members. in this relatively small cohort of patients undergoing tumor genomic testing for gastrointestinal malignancies, we incidentally identified 3 brca2 mutations carriers. this report underscores the need for oncologists to develop a framework for pre- and post-test communication of risks to patients undergoing routine tumor-only sequencing.	-1
fabry disease and multiple sclerosis misdiagnosis: the role of family history and neurological signs.  fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by ? galactosidase a (?-gal a) deficiency. central nervous system involvement and chronic white matter lesions are observed in both fd and multiple sclerosis (ms), which can confound the differential diagnosis. we analyzed the gla gene, which encodes ?-gal a, in 86 patients with clinical and neuroradiological findings consistent with ms to determine whether they had fd. we identified four women initially diagnosed with ms who hadgla mutations associated with fd. our results indicate that family history besides neurological findings should be evaluated in patients with an uncertain diagnosis of ms. also the involvement of organs outside the central nervous system can support the fd diagnosis.	-1
early gastric cancer in young, asymptomatic carriers of germ-line e-cadherin mutations.  germ-line truncating mutations in the e-cadherin (cdh1) gene have been found in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. these families are characterized by a highly penetrant susceptibility to diffuse gastric cancer with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, predominantly in young persons. we describe genetic screening, surgical management, and pathological findings in young persons with truncating mutations in cdh1 from two unrelated families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. mutation-specific predictive genetic testing was performed by polymerase-chain-reaction amplification, followed by restriction-enzyme digestion and dna sequencing in family 1 and by heteroduplex analysis in family 2. a total gastrectomy was performed prophylactically in five carriers of mutations who were between 22 and 40 years old. in each case, the entire mucosa of the stomach was extensively sampled for microscopical analysis. superficial infiltrates of malignant signet-ring cells were identified in the surgical samples from all five persons who underwent gastrectomy. these early diffuse gastric cancers were multifocal in three of the five cases, and in one person infiltrates of malignant signet-ring cells were present in 65 of the 140 tissue blocks analyzed, representing in aggregate less than 2 percent of the gastric mucosa. we recommend genetic counseling and consideration of prophylactic gastrectomy in young, asymptomatic carriers of germ-line truncating cdh1 mutations who belong to families with highly penetrant hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.	-1
screening for germ line tp53 mutations in breast cancer patients.  the constant denaturant gel electrophoresis technique was used to screen for tp53 germ line mutations in 237 women with breast carcinoma (167 unselected patients, 30 patients with at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer, and 40 women diagnosed with breast cancer before age 35). a germ line mutation at codon 181 was noted in one of the unselected patients and a codon 245 mutation in one of the early-onset patients. both had a family history of breast cancer and other malignancies suggestive of li-fraumeni syndrome. the codon 245 mutation was also present in this patient's affected mother.	-1
microvascular function is selectively impaired in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and sarcomere myofilament gene mutations.  the purpose of this study was to assess myocardial blood flow (mbf) using positron emission tomography in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) according to genetic status. coronary microvascular dysfunction is an important feature of hcm, associated with ventricular remodeling and heart failure. we recently demonstrated the increased prevalence of systolic dysfunction in patients with hcm with sarcomere myofilament gene mutations and postulated an association between genetic status and coronary microvascular dysfunction. maximum mbf (intravenous dipyridamole, 0.56 mg/kg; dip-mbf) was measured using (13)n-labeled ammonia in 61 patients with hcm (age 38  14 years), genotyped by automatic dna sequencing of 8 myofilament-encoding genes (myosin-binding protein c, beta-myosin heavy chain, regulatory and essential light chains, troponin t, troponin i, troponin c, alpha-tropomyosin, and alpha-actin). in 35 patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed. fifty-three mutations were identified in 42 of the 61 patients (genotype positive; 69%). despite similar clinical profiles, genotype-positive patients with hcm showed substantially lower dip-mbf compared with that of genotype-negative patients (1.7  0.6 ml/min/g vs. 2.4  1.2 ml/min/g; p < 0.02). a dip-mbf <1.5 ml/min/g had 81% positive predictive value for genotype-positive status and implied a 3.5-fold independent increase in likelihood of carrying myofilament gene mutations (hazard ratio: 3.52; 95% confidence interval: 1.05 to 11.7; p = 0.04). at cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the prevalence of late gadolinium enhancement was greater in genotype-positive patients (22 of 23 [96%] compared with 8 of 12 [67%] genotype-negative patients; p = 0.038). patients with hcm with sarcomere myofilament mutations are characterized by more severe impairment of microvascular function and increased prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, compared with genotype-negative individuals. these findings suggest a direct link between sarcomere gene mutations and adverse remodeling of the microcirculation in hcm, accounting for the increased long-term prevalence of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure in genotype-positive patients.	-1
eight new mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in italian patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.  this report identifies eight new mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene detected in italian patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. the trivial name of the mutations, predicted phenotypic effect, and population of origin (italian region) are as follows: f55l (nonconservative change: classic, moderate, mild pku ?; sicily), ivs2nt-13 (splicing defect, classic pku; tuscany), i65n (nonconservative change classic, moderate, mild pku ?; sicily), h201y (non-pku hpa; sicily), i269l (non-pku hpa, or polymorphism; sicily), ivs7nt3 (splicing defect or polymorphism; sicily), i283n (classic pku; sicily), ivs12nt2 (splicing defect, classic pku; sicily and apulia). in sicily, the relative frequency of mutations f55l, i65n, h201y, i269l, ivs7nt3, i283n, ivs12nt2 is < 1%. the seven new mutations identified in the sicilian population increase the remarkable genetic heterogeneity typical of this population with an estimated homozygosity value at the pah locus of 0.041.	-1
the parvalbumin/somatostatin ratio is increased in pten mutant mice and by human pten asd alleles.  mutations in the phosphatase pten are strongly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (asd). here, we investigate the function of pten in cortical gabaergic neurons using conditional mutagenesis in mice. loss of pten results in a preferential loss of sst(+) interneurons, which increases the ratio of parvalbumin/somatostatin (pv/sst) interneurons, ectopic pv(+) projections in layer i, and inhibition onto glutamatergic cortical neurons. pten mutant mice exhibit deficits in social behavior and changes in electroencephalogram (eeg) power. using medial ganglionic eminence (mge) transplantation, we test for cell-autonomous functional differences between human pten wild-type (wt) and asd alleles. the pten asd alleles are hypomorphic in regulating cell size and the pv/sst ratio in comparison to wt pten. this mge transplantation/complementation assay is efficient and is generally applicable for functional testing of asd alleles in vivo.	1
long-term treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin in phenylketonuria: treatment strategies and prediction of long-term responders.  tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsive phenylketonuria has been described more than 10 years ago. however, criteria for the identification of long-term bh4 responsive patients are not yet established. 116 patients with phenylketonuria, aged 4-18 years, were screened for potential long-term bh4 responsiveness by at least two of the following criteria: positive neonatal bh4 loading test, putative bh4 responsive genotype, and/or milder phenotype. patients had to be on permanent dietary treatment. 23 patients fulfilled these criteria and were tested for long-term bh4 responsiveness: 18/23 were long-term bh4 responsive, 5/23 were not. on long-term bh4 treatment over a period of 48  27 months in a dose of 14.9  3.3mg/kg/day phenylalanine tolerance was increased from 452  201 mg/day to 1593  647 mg/day, corresponding to a mean increase of 1141  528 mg/day. dietary phenylalanine intake was increased stepwise according to a clear defined protocol. in 8/18 patients, diet was completely liberalized; 10/18 patients still received phenylalanine-free amino acid formula with 0.63  0.23 g/kg/day. the most predictive value for long-term bh4 responsiveness was the combination of pretreatment phenylalanine of < 1200 ?mol/l, pretreatment phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio of <15, phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio of <15 on treatment, phenylalanine tolerance of >20mg/kg/day at age 3 years, positive neonatal bh4 loading, and at least one putative bh4 responsive mutation (p = 0.00024). our data show that long-term bh4 responsiveness may be predicted already during neonatal period by determining maximum pretreatment phenylalanine and phenylalanine/tyrosine concentrations, neonatal bh4 loading and pah genotype. a clear defined protocol is necessary to install long-term bh4 treatment.	-1
mutations in the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase and response to tetrahydrobiopterin.  tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) is a co-factor that enhances the activity of other enzymes, and this co-factor level is found to be affected in phenylketonuria (pku), an amino acid metabolism disorder. the present study was aimed at understanding the effect of bh4 on mutations in the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). among 14 patients, 5 patients were classical pku, 3 were atypical pku, and 6 were mild pku. all of these patients had at least one mutation in the regulatory domain. patients were given 10 mg/kg bh4, and the response of blood phenylalanine (phe) levels was monitored following treatment. the level of blood phe decreased after bh4 treatment in all of the patients. these studies suggest that mutations in the regulatory domain also responded to bh4 even if the patient had classical pku.	-1
systematic functional interrogation of rare cancer variants identifies oncogenic alleles.  cancer genome characterization efforts now provide an initial view of the somatic alterations in primary tumors. however, most point mutations occur at low frequency, and the function of these alleles remains undefined. we have developed a scalable systematic approach to interrogate the function of cancer-associated gene variants. we subjected 474 mutant alleles curated from 5,338 tumors to pooled in vivo tumor formation assays and gene expression profiling. we identified 12 transforming alleles, including two in genes (pik3cb, pot1) that have not been shown to be tumorigenic. one rare kras allele, d33e, displayed tumorigenicity and constitutive activation of known ras effector pathways. by comparing gene expression changes induced upon expression of wild-type and mutant alleles, we inferred the activity of specific alleles. because alleles found to be mutated only once in 5,338 tumors rendered cells tumorigenic, these observations underscore the value of integrating genomic information with functional studies. experimentally inferring the functional status of cancer-associated mutations facilitates the interpretation of genomic information in cancer. pooled in vivo screen and gene expression profiling identified functional variants and demonstrated that expression of rare variants induced tumorigenesis. variant phenotyping through functional studies will facilitate defining key somatic events in cancer. cancer discov; 6(7); 714-26. 2016 aacr.see related commentary by cho and collisson, p. 694this article is highlighted in the in this issue feature, p. 681.	1
point mutations in tor confer rheb-independent growth in fission yeast and nutrient-independent mammalian tor signaling in mammalian cells.  rheb is a unique member of the ras superfamily gtp-binding proteins. we as well as others previously have shown that rheb is a critical component of the tsc/tor signaling pathway. in fission yeast, rheb is encoded by the rhb1 gene. rhb1p is essential for growth and directly interacts with tor2p. in this article, we report identification of 22 single amino acid changes in the tor2 protein that enable growth in the absence of rhb1p. these mutants also exhibit decreased mating efficiency. interestingly, the mutations are located in the c-terminal half of the tor2 protein, clustering mainly within the fat and kinase domains. we noted some differences in the effect of a mutation in the fat domain (l1310p) and in the kinase domain (e2221k) on growth and mating. although the tor2p mutations bypass rhb1p's requirement for growth, they are incapable of suppressing rhb1p's requirement for resistance to stress and toxic amino acids, pointing to multiple functions of rhb1p. in mammalian systems, we find that mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) carrying analogous mutations (l1460p or e2419k), although sensitive to rapamycin, exhibits constitutive activation even when the cells are starved for nutrients. these mutations do not show significant difference in their ability to form complexes with raptor, rictor, or mlst8. furthermore, we present evidence that mutant mtor can complex with wild-type mtor and that this heterodimer is active in nutrient-starved cells.	1
p53 gain-of-function cancer mutants induce genetic instability by inactivating atm.  tp53 is the most commonly mutated tumour-suppressor gene in human cancers. in addition to the loss of tumour-suppression function, some missense mutants gain novel oncogenic activities. to elucidate the nature of the gain of function, we introduced the most common p53 cancer mutations (r248w and r273h) independently into the humanized p53 knock-in (hupki) allele in mice. tumour-suppressor functions of p53 are abolished in p53-mutant mice. several lines of evidence further indicate gain-of-function of p53 mutants in promoting tumorigenesis. p53(r248w) mice rapidly succumb to certain types of cancers not commonly observed in p53(-/-) mice. interchromosomal translocations, a type of genetic instability rarely observed in p53(-/-) cells, are readily detectable in p53-mutant pre-tumor thymocytes. although normal in p53(-/-) mouse cells, the g(2)-m checkpoint is impaired in p53-mutant cells after dna damage. these acquired oncogenic properties of mutant p53 could be explained by the findings that these p53 mutants interact with the nuclease mre11 and suppress the binding of the mre11-rad50-nbs1 (mrn) complex to dna double-stranded breaks (dsbs), leading to impaired ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) activation. therefore, p53 gain-of-function mutants promote tumorigenesis by a novel mechanism involving active disruption of critical dna damage-response pathways.	1
the tp53 mutation, r337h, is associated with li-fraumeni and li-fraumeni-like syndromes in brazilian families.  a tp53 germline mutation, r337h, has been previously described in children from southern brazil with adrenocortical tumours but no documented familial history of other cancers. here, we have screened for tp53 mutation 45 brazilian unrelated individuals with family histories fulfilling the clinical definitions of li-fraumeni (lfs) or li-fraumeni-like (lfl) syndromes. mutations were found in 13 patients (28.9%), including six (46.1%) r337h mutations, and four novel germline mutations (v173m, v197m, g244d and ivs6+1g>t). families with the r337h mutation presented a wide spectrum of tumours, including breast cancers (30.4%), brain cancers (10.7%), soft tissue sarcomas (10.7%) and adrenocortical carcinomas (8.9%). testing of 53 brazilian subjects with no cancer history showed that r337h was not a common polymorphism in that population. moreover, loss of heterozygocity with retention of the r337h allele was observed in a breast adenocarcinoma, supporting a role for this mutation in breast tumorigenesis. these results show that the tp53 r337h germline mutation predisposes to a larger spectrum of tumours, similar to the one reported for other tp53 mutations.	-1
origins and frequencies of slc26a4 (pds) mutations in east and south asians: global implications for the epidemiology of deafness.  recessive mutations of slc26a4 (pds) are a common cause of pendred syndrome and non-syndromic deafness in western populations. although south and east asia contain nearly one half of the global population, the origins and frequencies of slc26a4 mutations in these regions are unknown. we pcr amplified and sequenced seven exons of slc26a4 to detect selected mutations in 274 deaf probands from korea, china, and mongolia. a total of nine different mutations of slc26a4 were detected among 15 (5.5%) of the 274 probands. five mutations were novel and the other four had seldom, if ever, been identified outside east asia. to identify mutations in south asians, 212 pakistani and 106 indian families with three or more affected offspring of consanguineous matings were analysed for cosegregation of recessive deafness with short tandem repeat markers linked to slc26a4. all 21 slc26a4 exons were pcr amplified and sequenced in families segregating slc26a4 linked deafness. eleven mutant alleles of slc26a4 were identified among 17 (5.4%) of the 318 families, and all 11 alleles were novel. slc26a4 linked haplotypes on chromosomes with recurrent mutations were consistent with founder effects. our observation of a diverse allelic series unique to each ethnic group indicates that mutational events at slc26a4 are common and account for approximately 5% of recessive deafness in south asians and other populations.	-1
functional and biological studies of ?-galactosidase a variants with uncertain significance from newborn screening in taiwan.  fabry disease is an x-linked disorder resulted from deficiency of ?-galactosidase a (gla) activity. in taiwan, a total of 792,247 newborns were screened from 2008 to 2014 in two newborn screening centers, and 13 variants of uncertain significance (vous) in the gla gene were identified. to determine whether these variants were pathogenic or not, functional, biochemical, clinical and pedigree analyses were performed. in vitro functional assay was established through site-directed mutagenesis, and four in silico tools were used to predict pathogenesis. the enzyme activity of dried blood spots and plasma metabolite lyso-gb3 level from subjects with the variants were measured. additionally, clinical manifestations were evaluated extensively from the subjects and their relatives. our results revealed that p.g104v, p.i232t, p.d322h, and p.g360c all exhibited relatively low residual enzyme activities and elevated plasma lyso-gb3 level. these data strongly suggest that these fabry mutations may cause classical or later-onset phenotypes. in contrast, neither significantly clinical symptoms nor elevated lyso-gb3 level was found in cases with p.p60s, p.a108t, p.s304t, p.r356q, and p.p362t variants, which may be non-pathogenic or milder forms of fabry variants. more data need to be included for the patients with p.n53d, p.p210s, p.m296l, and p.k391t variants. the established system provides us more information to classify these gla variants.	1
characterization of usher syndrome type i gene mutations in an usher syndrome patient population.  usher syndrome type i (ush1), the most severe form of this syndrome, is characterized by profound congenital sensorineural deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and retinitis pigmentosa. at least seven ush1 loci, ush1a-g, have been mapped to the chromosome regions 14q32, 11q13.5, 11p15, 10q21-q22, 21q21, 10q21-q22, and 17q24-25, respectively. mutations in five genes, including myo7a, ush1c, cdh23, pcdh15 and sans, have been shown to be the cause of usher syndrome type 1b, type 1c, type 1d, type 1f and type 1g, respectively. in the present study, we carried out a systematic mutation screening of these genes in ush1 patients from usa and from uk. we identified a total of 27 different mutations; of these, 19 are novel, including nine missense, two nonsense, four deletions, one insertion and three splicing defects. approximatelly 35-39% of the observed mutations involved the ush1b and ush1d genes, followed by 11% for ush1f and 7% for ush1c in non-acadian alleles and 7% for ush1g. two of the 12 myo7a mutations, r666x and ivs40-1g > t accounted for 38% of the mutations at that locus. a 193delc mutation accounted for 26% of cdh23 (ush1d) mutations, confirming its high frequency. the most common pcdh15 (ush1f) mutation in this study, 5601-5603delaac, accounts for 33% of mutant alleles. interestingly, a novel sans mutation, w38x, was observed only in the usa cohort. the present study suggests that mutations in myo7a and cdh23 are the two major components of causes for ush1, while pcdh15, ush1c, and sans are less frequent causes.	-1
analysis of trafficking, stability and function of human connexin 26 gap junction channels with deafness-causing mutations in the fourth transmembrane helix.  human connexin26 gene mutations cause hearing loss. these hereditary mutations are the leading cause of childhood deafness worldwide. mutations in gap junction proteins (connexins) can impair intercellular communication by eliminating protein synthesis, mis-trafficking, or inducing channels that fail to dock or have aberrant function. we previously identified a new class of mutants that form non-functional gap junction channels and hemichannels (connexons) by disrupting packing and inter-helix interactions. here we analyzed fourteen point mutations in the fourth transmembrane helix of connexin26 (cx26) that cause non-syndromic hearing loss. eight mutations caused mis-trafficking (k188r, f191l, v198m, s199f, g200r, i203k, l205p, t208p). of the remaining six that formed gap junctions in mammalian cells, m195t and a197s formed stable hemichannels after isolation with a baculovirus/sf9 protein purification system, while c202f, i203t, l205v and n206s formed hemichannels with varying degrees of instability. the function of all six gap junction-forming mutants was further assessed through measurement of dye coupling in mammalian cells and junctional conductance in paired xenopus oocytes. dye coupling between cell pairs was reduced by varying degrees for all six mutants. in homotypic oocyte pairings, only a197s induced measurable conductance. in heterotypic pairings with wild-type cx26, five of the six mutants formed functional gap junction channels, albeit with reduced efficiency. none of the mutants displayed significant alterations in sensitivity to transjunctional voltage or induced conductive hemichannels in single oocytes. intra-hemichannel interactions between mutant and wild-type proteins were assessed in rescue experiments using baculovirus expression in sf9 insect cells. of the four unstable mutations (c202f, i203t, l205v, n206s) only c202f and n206s formed stable hemichannels when co-expressed with wild-type cx26. stable m195t hemichannels displayed an increased tendency to aggregate. thus, mutations in tm4 cause a range of phenotypes of dysfunctional gap junction channels that are discussed within the context of the x-ray crystallographic structure.	1

the origins of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-causing mutations in two south african subpopulations: a unique profile of both independent and founder events.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease of the cardiac sarcomere, caused by numerous mutations in genes encoding protein components of this structure. mutation carriers are at risk of sudden cardiac death, mostly as adolescents or young adults. the reproductive disadvantage incurred may explain both the global occurrence of diverse independent hcm-associated mutations and the rare reports of founder effects within populations. we have investigated whether this holds true for two south african subpopulations, one of mixed ancestry and one of northern-european descent. previously, we had detected three novel mutations-ala797thr in the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene (betamhc), arg92trp in the cardiac troponin t gene (ctnt), and arg645his in the myosin-binding protein c gene (mybpc)-and two documented betamhc mutations (arg403trp and arg249gln). here we report three additional novel mutations-gln499lys in betamhc and val896met and deltac756 in mybpc-and the documented betamhc arg719gln mutation. seven of the nine hcm-causing mutations arose independently; no conclusions can be drawn for the remaining two. however, the betamhc arg403trp and ala797thr and ctnt arg92trp mutations were detected in another one, eight, and four probands, respectively, and haplotype analysis in families carrying these recurring mutations inferred their origin from three common ancestors. the milder phenotype of the betamhc mutations may account for the presence of these founder effects, whereas population dynamics alone may have overridden the reproductive disadvantage incurred by the more lethal, ctnt arg92trp mutation.	-1
in vitro expression analysis of mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase: linking genotype to phenotype and structure to function.  mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah) altering the expressed cdna nucleotide sequence (genbank u49897) can impair activity of the corresponding enzyme product (hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase, pah) and cause hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa), a metabolic phenotype for which the major disease form is phenylketonuria (pku; omim 261600). in vitro expression analysis of inherited human mutations in eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and cell-free systems is informative about the mechanisms of mutation effects on enzymatic activity and their predicted effect on the metabolic phenotype. corresponding analysis of site-directed mutations in rat pah cdna has assigned critical functional roles to individual amino acid residues within the best understood species of phenylalanine hydroxylase. data on in vitro expression of 35 inherited human mutations and 22 created rat mutations are reviewed here. the core data are accessible at the pah mutation analysis consortium web site (http://www.mcgill.ca/pahdb).	1
[clinical manifestations, course and outcome of enzyme replacement therapy in hungarian patients with pompe's disease].  pompe's disease is an autosomal recessive disease caused by deficiency of acid-alpha-glucosidase. authors analyzed the phenotype of 11 hungarian patients with pompe's disease and evaluated clinical parameters and response to enzyme replacement therapy during a long-term follow-up in 8 patients. one patient with atypical infantile form presented with cardiomyopathy and a very slow progression of motor deficits; after 2 years of enzyme replacement therapy no disability was present at the age 6 years. another patient was asymptomatic at the age of 2.5 years. the adult onset form was characterized by slight to prominent limb-girdle myopathy with an age of onset between 20 and 50 years. in 3 of such cases respiratory insufficiency was also present. hungarian patients with pompe's disease presented with a wide phenotypic variability ranging from atypical early childhood form with slowly progressive course to late-onset limb-girdle myopathy with variable courses. enzyme replacement therapy resulted in significant improvement in motor and respiratory functions in most of the patients.	-1
functional evaluation of pten missense mutations using in vitro phosphoinositide phosphatase assay.  the tumor suppressor gene pten is frequently mutated in diverse human cancers and in autosomal dominant cancer predisposition disorders. recent studies have shown that the lipid phosphatase activity of pten is critical for its tumor suppressor function and that pten negatively regulates the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-protein kinase b pathway. although more than half of pten mutations result in protein truncation, a significant fraction of pten mutations are missense mutations. to examine whether tumor-derived and germ-line-derived missense mutations inactivate pten lipid phosphatase function, we constructed 42 distinct types of pten missense mutations and expressed them in escherichia coli. the purified (his)6-tagged pten proteins were tested for their ability to dephosphorylate inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate. in addition, we examined the effect of mutant ptens on the ability of pten to bind to the phospholipid membrane. the results revealed that the majority of pten missense mutations [38 of 42 (90%)] eliminated or reduced phosphatase activity and that all of the mutations examined had no effect on the membrane binding activity of pten. our study indicated that phosphoinositide phosphatase activity is important for the tumor suppressor function of pten and that there may be other mechanisms of pten inactivation that are not monitored by in vitro phosphatase assay and in vitro membrane binding assay.	1
lhermitte-duclos disease and giant meningioma as manifestations of cowden's disease.  a 43-year-old man with synchronous occurrence of lhermitte-duclos disease (dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum) and a giant meningioma with subcutaneous infiltration is reported. subsequent examinations revealed typical manifestations of cowden's disease (multiple hamartomaneoplasia syndrome), i.e. mucocutaneous lesions and increased head circumference. our findings support the view that there is a correlation between lhermitte-duclos disease and cowden's disease. we conclude that all patients with lhermitte-duclos disease should be thoroughly examined with regard to cowden's disease, which necessitates lifelong follow-up with screening for neoplasia in various organ systems. the occurrence of both lhermitte-duclos disease and a meningioma as part of the cowden's symptom complex is very rare and to our knowledge only one case with this combination of lesions has previously been reported.	-1
mutations in myosin viia (myo7a) and usherin (ush2a) in spanish patients with usher syndrome types i and ii, respectively.  usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital hearing impairment and retinitis pigmentosa. three clinical types are known (ush1, ush2 and ush3), and there is an extensive genetic heterogeneity, with at least ten genes implicated. the most frequently mutated genes are myo7a, which causes ush1b, and usherin, which causes ush2a. we carried out a mutation analysis of these two genes in the spanish population. analysis of the myo7a gene in patients from 30 ush1 families and sporadic cases identified 32% of disease alleles, with mutation q821x being the most frequent. most of the remaining variants are private mutations. with regard to ush2, mutation 2299delg was detected in 25% of the spanish patients. altogether the mutations detected in ush2a families account for 23% of the disease alleles.	-1

novel mutations and a mutational hotspot in the mody3 gene.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young 3 (mody3) is a type of niddm caused by mutations in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (hnf-1alpha) located on chromosome 12q. we have identified four novel hnf-1alpha missense mutations in mody3 families. in four additional and unrelated families, we observed an identical insertion mutation that had occurred in a polycytidine tract in exon 4. among those families, one exhibited a de novo mutation at this location. we propose that instability of this sequence represents a general mutational mechanism in mody3. we observed no hnf-1alpha mutations among 86 unrelated late-onset diabetic patients with relative insulin deficiency. hence mutations in this gene appear to be most strongly associated with early-onset diabetes.	-1
long-chain l 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase (lchad) deficiency does not appear to be the primary cause of lipid myopathy in patients with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs).  in order to test the hypothesis that long-chain l 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme a dehydrogenase (lchad) deficiency is associated with the lipid myopathy and muscle carnitine deficiency observed in bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs), we studied the enzyme activity in cultured skin fibroblasts from three generations of a family with a clear dominant inheritance of brrs. enzyme activities were normal while the germline pten missense mutation p246l segregated with brrs in this family. no pten mutations were identified in the original patient with brrs and lchad deficiency. these data suggest that the previously reported case of lchad and brrs either represents the coincidental concurrence of two rare genetic events or that a gene other than pten is related to lchad and brrs.	-1
e-cadherin mutations and cell motility: a genotype-phenotype correlation.  e-cadherin has a determinant role in tumour progression, acting as an invasion and metastasis suppressor. germline mutations of e-cadherin gene (cdh1) occur in 30% of families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc); of these 23% are missense mutations. the cdh1 missense mutations described to date span the entire gene and some lead to significant functional consequences. in this study, we explored the hypothesis that mutations affecting different e-cadherin protein domains have distinct effects on cell motility. to accomplish our objective we characterized the effect of eleven hdgc cdh1 germline missense mutations (t118r, l214p, g239r, a298t, t340a, p373l, r749w, e757k, e781d, p799r and v832m) on cell motility. further, we studied their effect on the activation of signalling pathways known to be relevant for cell motility such as the egfr, src kinase and mapks. cdh1 mutations localized on the extracellular and juxtamembrane domains, both affecting the integrity of the extracellular domain, led to increased cell motility accompanied by increased egfr activation. moreover, we observed that cells expressing extracellular mutants exhibit increased activation of src kinase and p38 mapk. our results allowed the identification of the e-cadherin domains pivotal for cell motility, further demonstrated a genotype-phenotype correlation, and defined a subset of hdgc cases which may benefit from egfr inhibitors.	1
genetics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in norway.  genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) became available in norway in 2003. here, we describe the results of this testing in probands with hcm referred until the end of 2012. the translated exons of mybpc3, myh7, tnni3, tnnt2, myl2 and myl3 were analyzed in two groups of probands. in group 1, comprising 696 probands above 1 year of age, a mutation was found in 203 patients (29.2%). of those, 5.9% were carriers of two mutations. mean age in double mutation carriers, single mutation carriers and mutation negative probands was 44 years ( 19 years), 50 years ( 5 years) and 55 years ( 6 years), respectively. in group 2, comprising 26 infants below the age of 1, a mutation was found in 15.4%. a total of 120 different mutations were found of which 51 (42.5%) were novel.	-1
e-cadherin gene variants in gastric cancer families whose probands are diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer.  to identify germline e-cadherin mutations responsible for the predisposition to diffuse gastric cancer (dgc) among the japanese, we screened 17 patients with familial aggregation of gastric cancer by sequencing analysis. all the patients were diagnosed with dgc and had at least 1 sibling with gastric cancer. two novel e-cadherin gene variants were detected. one was detected in 1 patient only and associated with an amino acid substitution (val/met) at codon 832 in the region essential for binding to beta-catenin. the m832 variant was detected not only in the proband but also in 2 other gastric cancer patients in the family. immunohistochemical analysis of gastric cancer tissue from the proband revealed that e-cadherin expression was markedly reduced and beta-catenin expression was also reduced in cancer cells. however, no significant difference in the activity of beta-catenin binding was detected between the m832 variant and v832 wild-type e-cadherin in immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation/western blot analyses. the other was detected in 5 patients and was located in the splice donor site (ivs1+6t/c); however, rt-pcr analysis indicated that the ivs+6c variant did not cause an aberrant splicing. thus, the m832 variant could be a germline mutation causative of familial aggregation of dgc, although further functional studies are needed to understand the pathogenic significance of this variant.	-1
the e-cadherin gene (cdh1) variants t340a and l599v in gastric and colorectal cancer patients in korea.  germline mutations in e-cadherin (cdh1) have been reported in families with early onset, diffuse gastric cancer. more recently, mutations in cdh1 have been described in colorectal cancer cell lines. we have investigated if germline mutations in cdh1 occur among different groups of korean gastric and colorectal cancer patients, with and without a positive family history. we studied 131 patients and 168 normal controls (88 korean and 80 non-korean). patients were divided into five groups: group i, 20 gastric cancer patients with a family history; group ii, 26 colorectal cancer patients with a family history of gastric cancer (those from familial adenomatous polyposis (fap) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (hnpcc) kindred were excluded); group iii, 16 hnpcc patients without identified germline mutations in hmlh1 and hmsh2; group iv, 35 gastric cancer patients without a family history; and group v, 34 colorectal cancer patients without a family history. polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformational polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and genotyping for identified variants were performed. several germline changes in cdh1 were found. in addition to previously described polymorphisms, we found three novel changes, two of which were missense changes (t340a and l599v). t340a was present in one patient in group iii and one in group v. l599v was present in one patient in group ii, in two in group iii, and in one in group iv. t340a was not found in normal controls while l599v was present in two of 88 korean controls. patients with these variants may appear to have a tendency to early onset cancer with a positive family history, although differences in frequencies did not reach statistical significance. genotyping results suggest that these variants might have a common origin, particularly t340a. we have described two new missense germline variants in cdh1 in various groups of korean gastrointestinal cancer patients. further work is required to assess if these variants increase the risk of gastrointestinal cancer.	-1
genetic analysis in 418 index patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy: overview of 10 years' experience.  with more than 40 dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm)-related genes known, genetic analysis of patients with idiopathic dcm is costly and time-consuming. we describe the yield from genetic analysis in dcm patients in a large dutch cohort. we collected cardiological and neurological evaluations, family screenings, and genetic analyses for 418 index patients with idiopathic dcm. we identified 35 (putative) pathogenic mutations in 82 index patients (20%). the type of dcm influenced the yield, with mutations found in 25% of familial dcm cases, compared with 8% of sporadic dcm cases and 62% of cases where dcm was accompanied by neuromuscular disease. a pln founder mutation (43 cases) and lmna mutations (19 cases, 16 different mutations) were most prevalent and often demonstrated a specific phenotype. other mutations were found in: myh7, des, tnnt2, dmd, tpm1, dmpk, scn5a, sgcb (homozygous), and tnni3. after a median follow-up of 40 months, the combined outcome of death from any cause, heart transplantation, or malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with a mutation was worse than in those without an identified mutation (hazard ratio 2.0, 95% confidence interval 1.4-3.0). this seems to be mainly attributable to a high prevalence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and end-stage heart failure in lmna and pln mutation carriers. the yield of identified mutations in dcm index patients with clinical clues, such as associated neuromuscular disease or familial occurrence, is higher compared with those without these clues. for sporadic dcm, specific clinical characteristics may be used to select cases for dna analysis.	-1

comprehensive genetic testing in the clinical evaluation of 1119 patients with hearing loss.  hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans, affecting 1 in 500 newborns. due to its genetic heterogeneity, comprehensive diagnostic testing has not previously been completed in a large multiethnic cohort. to determine the aggregate contribution inheritance makes to non-syndromic hearing loss, we performed comprehensive clinical genetic testing with targeted genomic enrichment and massively parallel sequencing on 1119 sequentially accrued patients. no patient was excluded based on phenotype, inheritance or previous testing. testing resulted in identification of the underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 patients (39%). pathogenic variants were found in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), large copy number changes (18%), small insertions and deletions (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%), and promoter variants (<1%). the diagnostic rate varied considerably based on phenotype and was highest for patients with a positive family history of hearing loss or when the loss was congenital and symmetric. the spectrum of implicated genes showed wide ethnic variability. these findings support the more efficient utilization of medical resources through the development of evidence-based algorithms for the diagnosis of hearing loss.	-1
long-term prognosis of patients with infantile-onset pompe disease diagnosed by newborn screening and treated since birth.  to determine the benefit of newborn screening for the long-term prognosis of patients with classic infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd). a cohort of patients with classic iopd were diagnosed by newborn screening, treated with recombinant human acid ?-glucosidase (rhgaa), and followed prospectively. outcome measurements included survival, left ventricular mass, serum creatinine kinase, motor function, mental development, and systemic manifestations. ten patients who presented with left ventricular hypertrophy at diagnosis received rhgaa infusions starting at a median age of 16 days (6-34 days). all patients were cross-reactive immunologic material-positive. after a median treatment time of 63 months (range 28-90 months), all could walk independently, and none required mechanical ventilation. all patients had motor capability sufficient for participating in daily activities, but muscle weakness over the pelvic girdle appeared gradually after 2 years of age. ptosis was present in one-half of the patients, and speech disorders were common. anti-rhgaa antibody titers were low (median maximal titer value 1:1600, range: undetectable ? 1:12,800). by studying patients treated since birth who have no significant anti-rhgaa antibody interference, this prospective study demonstrates that the efficacy of rhgaa therapy is high and consistent for the treatment of classic iopd. this study also exposes limitations of rhgaa treatment. the etiology of the manifestations in these early-treated patients will require further study.	-1
identification of fifteen novel mutations and genotype-phenotype relationship in fabry disease.  fabry disease is an x-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase a, which results in a progressive multisystem disease. most families have private mutations and no general correlation between genotype and disease manifestations has been described to date. forty-nine patients (47 males and 2 females) from 36 affected families were selected for the study. their evaluation included clinical examination, identification of alpha-galactosidase a gene mutations and residual enzymatic activity. for mutation detection, each exon with flanking intronic sequences was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from the patient's genomic dna and sequenced. analysis of the resulting sequences was conducted to identify structural defects in the gene. each of the fabry patients carried a mutation in the alpha-galactosidase a gene. fifteen mutations were novel. they included missense mutations (m51k, y123m, g261d), nonsense point mutations (e251x) and small insertions or deletions creating a premature translational termination signal (p6x, d93x, w162x, k240x, h302x, i303x, l403x, s345x, g375x, f396x). residual alpha-galactosidase a activity was significantly lower in patients with neuropathic pain (p=0.01) and in patients with mutations leading to a nonconservative amino acid change (p=0.04). our findings emphasize the wide variety of genetic mechanisms leading to fabry disease. a significant genotype-phenotype relationship was found.	-1
recombinant human acid [alpha]-glucosidase: major clinical benefits in infantile-onset pompe disease.  pompe disease is a progressive metabolic neuromuscular disorder resulting from deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). infantile-onset pompe disease is characterized by cardiomyopathy, respiratory and skeletal muscle weakness, and early death. the safety and efficacy of recombinant human (rh) gaa were evaluated in 18 patients with rapidly progressing infantile-onset pompe disease. patients were diagnosed at 6 months of age and younger and exhibited severe gaa deficiency and cardiomyopathy. patients received iv infusions of rhgaa at 20 mg/kg (n = 9) or 40 mg/kg (n = 9) every other week. analyses were performed 52 weeks after the last patient was randomized to treatment. all patients (100%) survived to 18 months of age. a cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that treatment reduced the risk of death by 99%, reduced the risk of death or invasive ventilation by 92%, and reduced the risk of death or any type of ventilation by 88%, as compared to an untreated historical control group. there was no clear advantage of the 40-mg/kg dose with regard to efficacy. eleven of the 18 patients experienced 164 infusion-associated reactions; all were mild or moderate in intensity. recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase is safe and effective for treatment of infantile-onset pompe disease. eleven patients experienced adverse events related to treatment, but none discontinued. the young age at which these patients initiated therapy may have contributed to their improved response compared to previous trials with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase in which patients were older.	-1
the value of muscle biopsies in pompe disease: identifying lipofuscin inclusions in juvenile- and adult-onset patients.  pompe disease, an inherited deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa), is a metabolic myopathy with heterogeneous clinical presentations. late-onset pompe disease (lopd) is a debilitating progressive muscle disorder that can occur anytime from early childhood to late adulthood. enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human gaa is currently available for pompe patients. although ert shows some benefits, the reversal of skeletal muscle pathology - lysosomal glycogen accumulation and autophagic buildup - remains a challenge. in this study, we examined the clinical status and muscle pathology of 22 lopd patients and one atypical infantile patient on ert to understand the reasons for muscle resistance to ert. the patients were divided into three groups for analysis, based on the age of onset and diagnosis: adult-onset patients, juvenile-onset patients, and those identified through newborn screening (nbs). the areas of autophagic buildup found in patients' biopsies of all three groups, contained large autofluorescent inclusions which we show are made of lipofuscin, an indigestible intralysosomal material typically associated with ageing. these inclusions, analysed by staining, spectral analysis, time-resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging (flim), and second harmonic generation (shg) imaging, were the major pathology remaining in many fibers after ert. the best outcome of ert both clinically and morphologically was observed in the nbs patients. the muscle biopsy, in spite of its shortcomings, allowed us to recognize an underreported, ert-resistant pathology in lopd; numerous lysosomes and autolysosomes loaded with lipofuscin appear to be a hallmark of lopd skeletal muscle. lipofuscin accumulation - a result of inefficient lysosomal degradation - may in turn exacerbate both lysosomal and autophagic abnormalities.	-1
the relationship among p53 oligomer formation, structure and transcriptional activity using a comprehensive missense mutation library.  tumor suppressor p53 forms a homo-tetramer through its cooh-terminal oligomerization domain and acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor. we have analysed the interrelation among the transcriptional activities, the structure and the cancer-related mutations in the oligomerization domain by using a comprehensive missense mutation library. here, we examined the ability of 184 mutant p53s in the domain to form an oligomer by expressing these mutant p53s in yeast, and compared the data with the previous information. we showed that specific residues in the alpha-helix and the beta-strand of the oligomerization domain were critical for both oligomer formation and sequence-specific transactivation, and the activities were closely related. in particular, the alpha-helix was more sensitive to amino-acid substitutions than the beta-strand. we found identity in the interrelation between the two activities, that is, monomer mutants were transcriptionally inactive whereas dimer and tetramer mutants retained their transcriptional activities. in tp53 mutation databases, a small number of mutations have been reported in this domain. surprisingly, most do not encode p53s defective in functional properties. these results indicate that, although oligomer formation is essential for p53 transactivation function, the inactivation of oligomer formation and therefore the inactivation of transactivation may not be essential for tumor suppression by p53 because they do not lead to oncogenic proteins.	1
glucokinase thermolability and hepatic regulatory protein binding are essential factors for predicting the blood glucose phenotype of missense mutations.  to better understand how glucokinase (gk) missense mutations associated with human glycemic diseases perturb glucose homeostasis, we generated and characterized mice with either an activating (a456v) or inactivating (k414e) mutation in the gk gene. animals with these mutations exhibited alterations in their blood glucose concentration that were inversely related to the relative activity index of gk. moreover, the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets with either the activating or inactivating mutation were left- or right-shifted, respectively. however, we were surprised to find that mice with the activating mutation had markedly reduced amounts of hepatic gk activity. further studies of bacterially expressed mutant enzymes revealed that gk(a456v) is as stable as the wild type enzyme, whereas gk(k414e) is thermolabile. however, the ability of gk regulatory protein to inhibit gk(a456v) was found to be less than that of the wild type enzyme, a finding consistent with impaired hepatic nuclear localization. taken together, this study indicates that it is necessary to have knowledge of both thermolability and the interactions of mutant gk enzymes with gk regulatory protein when attempting to predict in vivo glycemic phenotypes based on the measurement of enzyme kinetics.	1
late-onset pompe disease in france: molecular features and epidemiology from a nationwide study.  pompe disease (pd) is caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase resulting from mutations in the gaa gene. the clinical spectrum ranges from a rapidly fatal multisystemic disorder (classic pd, onset < 1 year) to a milder adult onset myopathy. the aims of this study were to characterize the gaa mutations, to establish the disease epidemiology, and to identify potential genotype-phenotype correlations in french late-onset pd patients (onset ? 2 years) diagnosed since the 1970s. data were collected from the two main laboratories involved in pd diagnosis and from the french pompe registry. two hundred forty-six patients (130 females and 116 males) were included, with a mean age at diagnosis of 43 years. eighty-three different mutations were identified in the gaa gene, among which 28 were novel. these variants were spread all over the sequence and included 42 missense (one affecting start codon), 8 nonsense, 15 frameshift, 14 splice mutations, 3 small in-frame deletions, and one large deletion. the common c.-32-13t>g mutation was detected in 151/170 index cases. other frequent mutations included the exon 18 deletion, the c.525del, and the missense mutations c.1927g>a (p.gly643arg) and c.655g>a (p.gly219arg). patients carrying the c.-32-13t>g mutation had an older mean age at onset than patients non-exhibiting this mutation (36 versus 25 years). patients with the same genotype had a highly variable age at onset. we estimated the frequency of late-onset pd in france around 1/69,927 newborns. in conclusion, we characterized the french cohort of late-onset pd patients through a nationwide study covering more than 40 years.	-1
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib enhances the activity of multiple mutant forms of lysosomal ?-glucosidase in pompe disease.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive myopathic disorder caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase (gaa). recently, we showed that function of mutant gaa in fibroblasts derived from pompe disease patient carrying c.546g>t mutation is improved by treatment with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as well as pharmacological chaperone (pc). however, bortezomib-responsive gaa mutations are not fully characterized. in this study, we showed the effect of bortezomib on different mutants of gaa in patient fibroblasts and transiently expressed hek293t cells. bortezomib increased the maturation and residual activity of gaa in patient fibroblasts carrying pc-responsive m519v and pc-unresponsive c647w mutations. enhanced colocalization of gaa with lysosomal marker lamp2 was also observed in patient fibroblasts after treatment with bortezomib. when four distinct mutant gaas, which show different response to pc, were overexpressed in hek293t cells, bortezomib improved the activity of m519v, s529v, and c647w in them (1.3-5.9-fold). these results indicate that bortezomib enhances the activity of some pc-unresponsive gaa mutants as well as pc-responsive mutants.	-1
molecular testing for familial hypercholesterolaemia-associated mutations in a uk-based cohort: development of an ngs-based method and comparison with multiplex polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide arrays.  background detection of disease-associated mutations in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia is crucial for early interventions to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease. screening for these mutations represents a methodological challenge since more than 1200 different causal mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor has been identified. a number of methodological approaches have been developed for screening by clinical diagnostic laboratories. methods using primers targeting, the low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein b, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, we developed a novel ion torrent-based targeted re-sequencing method. we validated this in a west midlands-uk small cohort of 58 patients screened in parallel with other mutation-targeting methods, such as multiplex polymerase chain reaction (elucigene fh20), oligonucleotide arrays (randox familial hypercholesterolaemia array) or the illumina next-generation sequencing platform. results in this small cohort, the next-generation sequencing method achieved excellent analytical performance characteristics and showed 100% and 89% concordance with the randox array and the elucigene fh20 assay. investigation of the discrepant results identified two cases of mutation misclassification of the elucigene fh20 multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay. a number of novel mutations not previously reported were also identified by the next-generation sequencing method. conclusions ion torrent-based next-generation sequencing can deliver a suitable alternative for the molecular investigation of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients, especially when comprehensive mutation screening for rare or unknown mutations is required.	-1
an african-specific polymorphism in the tp53 gene impairs p53 tumor suppressor function in a mouse model.  a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism at codon 47 in tp53 exists in african-descent populations (p47s, rs1800371; referred to here as s47). here we report that, in human cell lines and a mouse model, the s47 variant exhibits a modest decrease in apoptosis in response to most genotoxic stresses compared with wild-type p53 but exhibits a significant defect in cell death induced by cisplatin. we show that, compared with wild-type p53, s47 has nearly indistinguishable transcriptional function but shows impaired ability to transactivate a subset of p53 target genes, including two involved in metabolism:gls2(glutaminase 2) and sco2 we also show that human and mouse cells expressing the s47 variant are markedly resistant to cell death by agents that induce ferroptosis (iron-mediated nonapoptotic cell death). we show that mice expressing s47 in homozygous or heterozygous form are susceptible to spontaneous cancers of diverse histological types. our data suggest that the s47 variant may contribute to increased cancer risk in individuals of african descent, and our findings highlight the need to assess the contribution of this variant to cancer risk in these populations. these data also confirm the potential relevance of metabolism and ferroptosis to tumor suppression by p53.	1
multicenter female fabry study (mffs) - clinical survey on current treatment of females with fabry disease.  the aim of the present study was to assess manifestations of and applied treatment concepts for females with fabry disease (fd) according to the current european fabry guidelines. between 10/2008 and 12/2014, data from the most recent visit of 261 adult female fd patients from six german fabry centers were retrospectively analyzed. clinical presentation and laboratory data, including plasma lyso-gb3 levels were assessed. fifty-five percent of females were on enzyme replacement therapy (ert), according to recent european fd guidelines. thirty-three percent of females were untreated although criteria for ert initiation were fulfilled. in general, the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) seemed to impact more on ert initiation than impaired renal function. in ert-nave females raas blockers were more often prescribed if lvh was present rather than albuminuria. affected females with missense mutations showed a similar disease burden compared to females with nonsense mutations. elevated plasma lyso-gb3 levels in ert-nave females seem to be a marker of disease burden, since patients showed comparable incidences of organ manifestations even if they were ~8 years younger than females with normal lyso-gb3 levels. the treatment of the majority of females with fd in germany is in line with the current european fd guidelines. however, a relevant number of females remain untreated despite organ involvement, necessitating a careful reevaluation of these females.	-1

a novel inherited mutation of the transcription factor runx1 causes thrombocytopenia and may predispose to acute myeloid leukaemia.  the runx1 (aml1, cbfa2) gene is a member of the runt transcription factor family, responsible for dna binding and heterodimerization of other non-dna binding transcription factors. runx1 plays an important part in regulating haematopoiesis and it is frequently disrupted by illegitimate somatic recombination in both acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukaemia. germline mutations of runx1 have also recently been described and are dominantly associated with inherited leukaemic conditions. we have identified a unique point mutation of the runx1 gene (a107p) in members of a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of thrombocytopenia. one member has developed acute myeloid leukaemia (aml).	-1
mutant alpha-galactosidase a enzymes identified in fabry disease patients with residual enzyme activity: biochemical characterization and restoration of normal intracellular processing by 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin.  fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of alpha-gal a (alpha-galactosidase a) activity. in order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying alpha-gal a deficiency in fabry disease patients with residual enzyme activity, enzymes with different missense mutations were purified from transfected cos-7 cells and the biochemical properties were characterized. the mutant enzymes detected in variant patients (a20p, e66q, m72v, i91t, r112h, f113l, n215s, q279e, m296i, m296v and r301q), and those found mostly in mild classic patients (a97v, a156v, l166v and r356w) appeared to have normal k(m) and v(max) values. the degradation of all mutants (except e59k) was partially inhibited by treatment with kifunensine, a selective inhibitor of er (endoplasmic reticulum) alpha-mannosidase i. metabolic labelling and subcellular fractionation studies in cos-7 cells expressing the l166v and r301q alpha-gal a mutants indicated that the mutant protein was retained in the er and degraded without processing. addition of dgj (1-deoxygalactonojirimycin) to the culture medium of cos-7 cells transfected with a large set of missense mutant alpha-gal a cdnas effectively increased both enzyme activity and protein yield. dgj was capable of normalizing intracellular processing of mutant alpha-gal a found in both classic (l166v) and variant (r301q) fabry disease patients. in addition, the residual enzyme activity in fibroblasts or lymphoblasts from both classic and variant hemizygous fabry disease patients carrying a variety of missense mutations could be substantially increased by cultivation of the cells with dgj. these results indicate that a large proportion of mutant enzymes in patients with residual enzyme activity are kinetically active. excessive degradation in the er could be responsible for the deficiency of enzyme activity in vivo, and the dgj approach may be broadly applicable to fabry disease patients with missense mutations.	1
identification of four novel mutations in the alpha glucosidase gene in five italian patients with infantile onset glycogen storage disease type ii.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha glucosidase. four novel mutations (c670t, g989a, g2188t, and delta 23 nt 828-850) were identified in five italian patients with the infantile form of the disease. the c670t mutation was present in two unrelated patients in heterozygosity; the effect on enzyme activity was assessed by in vitro expression. cos-1 cells expressing the c670t allele had a twofold higher activity than the negative control cells. the g989a and g2188t point mutations lead to the introduction of premature stop signals that results in truncated forms of alpha glucosidase. the in vitro expression of g2188t allele demonstrated no increment in activity compared to negative control. the frame shifting deletion of nucleotides 828-850 was identified in one patient in heterozygosity. the shift in the reading frame introduces a stop codon 135 nucleotides downstream the deletion junction that results in a truncated protein without catalytic activity. nested pcr screening showed that the mutation was carried by the mother and was absent in the other members of the family. the four novel severe mutations herein described concerned only infantile onset gsdii patients; the loss of enzyme activity is correlated with the severity of the disease.	-1
molecular basis of gain-of-function leopard syndrome-associated shp2 mutations.  the src homology 2 (sh2) domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (shp2) is a critical signal transducer downstream of growth factors that promotes the activation of the ras-erk1/2 cascade. in its basal state, shp2 exists in an autoinhibited closed conformation because of an intramolecular interaction between its n-sh2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase (ptp) domains. binding to ptyr ligands present on growth factor receptors and adaptor proteins with its n-sh2 domain localizes shp2 to its substrates and frees the active site from allosteric inhibition. germline mutations in shp2 are known to cause both noonan syndrome (ns) and leopard syndrome (ls), two clinically similar autosomal dominant developmental disorders. ns-associated shp2 mutants display elevated phosphatase activity, while ls-associated shp2 mutants exhibit reduced catalytic activity. a conundrum in how clinically similar diseases result from mutations to shp2 that have opposite effects on this enzyme's catalytic functionality exists. here we report a comprehensive investigation of the kinetic, structural, dynamic, and biochemical signaling properties of the wild type as well as all reported ls-associated shp2 mutants. the results reveal that ls-causing mutations not only affect shp2 phosphatase activity but also induce a weakening of the intramolecular interaction between the n-sh2 and ptp domains, leading to mutants that are more readily activated by competing ptyr ligands. our data also indicate that the residual phosphatase activity associated with the ls shp2 mutant is required for enhanced erk1/2 activation. consequently, catalytically impaired shp2 mutants could display gain-of-function properties because of their ability to localize to the vicinity of substrates for longer periods of time, thereby affording the opportunity for prolonged substrate turnover and sustained ras-erk1/2 activation.	1
a myosin missense mutation, not a null allele, causes familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is characterized by myocardial hypertrophy of unknown etiology. missense mutations of the cardiac beta-myosin-heavy-chain (beta-mhc) gene that may be responsible for cardiac hypertrophy have been detected in patients with hcm. on the other hand, gross structural abnormalities in the cardiac beta-mhc gene, ie, an alpha/beta hybrid gene and partial deletion of the gene, have also been reported. the direct correlation between gross abnormalities and development of hcm is not well understood. we analyzed the structure of the cardiac beta-mhc gene from patients with hcm by using polymerase chain reaction-dna conformation polymorphism analysis and found two sequence variations in exons 3 and 22 in one patient. these sequence variations at codon 54 (exon 3; nonsense mutation) and codon 870 (exon 22; arg-to-his mutation) were identified by direct sequencing and dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. relatives of this patient were examined for the mutations. it was revealed that the missense mutation was inherited from the affected father and the nonsense mutation from the unaffected grandmother through the unaffected mother. in addition, the missense mutation was also found in seven other patients from two other unrelated multiplex hcm families. the arg870his mutation was suggested to cause hcm. in contrast, the gene with the nonsense mutation would encode for a cardiac beta-mhc protein of only 53 amino acid residues, which may be too short to be incorporated into the thick filament assembly of cardiac myosin chains and showed no dominant phenotype of heart disease. this is the first report of a nonsense mutation in the human cardiac beta-mhc gene.	-1
genetic analysis through otoseq of pakistani families segregating prelingual hearing loss.  to identify the genetic cause of prelingual sensorineural hearing loss in pakistani families using a next-generation sequencing (ngs)-based mutation screening test named otoseq. prospective study. research laboratory. we used 3 fluorescently labeled short tandem repeat (str) markers for each of the known autosomal recessive nonsyndromic (dfnb) and usher syndrome (ush) locus to perform a linkage analysis of 243 multigenerational pakistani families segregating prelingual hearing loss. after genotyping, we focused on 34 families with potential linkage to myo7a, cdh23, and slc26a4. we screened affected individuals from a subset of these families using the otoseq platform to identify underlying genetic variants. sanger sequencing was performed to confirm and study the segregation of mutations in other family members. for novel mutations, normal hearing individuals from ethnically matched backgrounds were also tested. hearing loss was found to co-segregate with locus-specific str markers for myo7a in 32 families, cdh23 in 1 family, and slc26a4 in 1 family. using the otoseq platform, a microdroplet pcr-based enrichment followed by ngs, we identified mutations in 28 of the 34 families including 11 novel mutations. sanger sequencing of these mutations showed 100% concordance with ngs data and co-segregation of the mutant alleles with the hearing loss phenotype in the respective families. using ngs-based platforms like otoseq in families segregating hearing loss will contribute to the identification of common and population-specific mutations, early diagnosis, genetic counseling, and molecular epidemiology.	-1
the identification of two mis-sense mutations at the pah gene locus in a turkish patient with phenylketonuria.  dna sequence analysis of the 13 exons and intron/exon boundaries of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene has detected two base transitions, resulting in mis-sense mutations, in the genomic dna of a turkish patient (e1) with phenylketonuria (pku). the leu48----ser amino acid substitution was associated with the mutant haplotype 3 allele and the glu221----gly amino acid substitution with the mutant haplotype 4 allele of this family. allele-specific oligonucleotide (aso) dot-blot analysis subsequently detected the leu48----ser mutation in the haplotype 4 pku alleles of nine (18.8%) of the 48 unrelated caucasian pku families investigated. this mutation results in mild pku in the homozygous state. the glu221----gly mutation has only been detected within patient e1 and his father.	-1
application of snpscan in genetic screening for common hearing loss genes.  the current study reports the successful application of a fast and efficient genetic screening system for common hearing loss (hl) genes based on snpscan genotyping technology. genetic analysis of 115 variants in common genes related to hl, gjb2, slc26a4 and mt-rnr, was performed on 695 subjects with non-syndromic hearing loss (nshl) from the northern china. the results found that 38.7% (269/695) of cases carried bi-allelic pathogenic variants in gjb2 and slc26a4 and 0.7% (5/695) of cases carried homoplasmic mt-rnr1 variants. the variant allele frequency of gjb2, slc26a4 and mt-rnr1 was 19.8% (275/1390), 21.9% (304/1390), and 0.86% (6/695), respectively. this approach can explain ~40% of nshl cases and thus is a useful tool for establishing primary molecular diagnosis of nshl in clinical genetics.	-1
paternal bias in parental origin of hras mutations in costello syndrome.  costello syndrome (cs) is a rare congenital condition caused by heterozygous de novo missense mutations affecting the codon for glycine 12 or 13 of the hras gene. we have identified 39 cs patients harboring the p.gly12ser mutation (nm_005343.2:c.34 g > a), two patients with c.35g > c mutations resulting in p.gly12ala substitutions, and one patient carrying the p.gly13cys substitution (c.37g > a). we analyzed the region flanking the mutated sites in 42 probands and 59 parents, and used four polymorphic markers to trace the parental origin of the germline mutations: one highly polymorphic hexanucleotide (gggcct) repeat region, defining three alleles with different numbers of repeat units (two, three, or four), and three snps. one of the snps, rs12628 (c.81t > c), was found in strong linkage disequilibrium with the hexanucleotide repeat region. out of a total of 24 probands with polymorphic markers, 16 informative families were tested and the paternal origin of the germline mutation was found in 14 cs probands; a distribution that is neither consistent with an equal likelihood of mutations arising in either parent (p = 0.0018), nor with exclusive paternal origin.	-1
the lipid phosphatase activity of pten is critical for its tumor supressor function.  since their discovery, protein tyrosine phosphatases have been speculated to play a role in tumor suppression because of their ability to antagonize the growth-promoting protein tyrosine kinases. recently, a tumor suppressor from human chromosome 10q23, called pten or mmac1, has been identified that shares homology with the protein tyrosine phosphatase family. germ-line mutations in pten give rise to several related neoplastic disorders, including cowden disease. a key step in understanding the function of pten as a tumor suppressor is to identify its physiological substrates. here we report that a missense mutation in pten, pten-g129e, which is observed in two cowden disease kindreds, specifically ablates the ability of pten to recognize inositol phospholipids as a substrate, suggesting that loss of the lipid phosphatase activity is responsible for the etiology of the disease. furthermore, expression of wild-type or substrate-trapping forms of pten in hek293 cells altered the levels of the phospholipid products of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ectopic expression of the phosphatase in pten-deficient tumor cell lines resulted in the inhibition of protein kinase (pk) b/akt and regulation of cell survival.	1
cdh1 mutations in gastric cancer patients from northern brazil identified by next- generation sequencing (ngs).  gastric cancer is considered to be the fifth highest incident tumor worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. developing regions report a higher number of sporadic cases, but there are only a few local studies related to hereditary cases of gastric cancer in brazil to confirm this fact. cdh1 germline mutations have been described both in familial and sporadic cases, but there is only one recent molecular description of individuals from brazil. in this study we performed next generation sequencing (ngs) to assess cdh1 germline mutations in individuals who match the clinical criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc), or who exhibit very early diagnosis of gastric cancer. among five probands we detected cdh1 germline mutations in two cases (40%). the mutation c.1023t > g was found in a hdgc family and the mutation c.1849g > a, which is nearly exclusive to african populations, was found in an early-onset case of gastric adenocarcinoma. the mutations described highlight the existence of gastric cancer cases caused by cdh1 germline mutations in northern brazil, although such information is frequently ignored due to the existence of a large number of environmental factors locally. our report represent the first cdh1 mutations in hdgc described from brazil by an ngs platform.	-1
characterization of glucokinase polymorphisms associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody2) in jordanian population.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young(mody) is a monogenic form of diabetes mellitus (dm) characterized by an autosomal dominant inheritance, onset usually before 25 years of age and a primary defect in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. glucokinase (gck) acts as a glucose sensor in the pancreatic beta cell and regulates insulin secretion. the mutation in the gene encoding gck results in enzyme inactivation cause mody2. functional studies of naturally occurring gck mutations associated with hyperglycaemia provide further insight into the biochemical basis of glucose sensor regulation. in this study 100 diabetic jordanian patients with mody2 phenotype and 150 normal control subjects were screened for the presence of gck gene mutations including the missense mutations at position thr228ala in exon 7, gly299arg in exon 8 and nonsense mutation ser383ter in exon 9, utilizing polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) analysis. the results shows no thr228ala, gly299arg and ser383ter mutations were detected in both groups, which was differ from the results obtained for italian and caucasian from the oxford region in uk mody2 patients. our data indicated that the previously studied mutations in italian and caucasian patients in the gck gene are not common in mody jordanian population, suggesting a racial difference can be found in the frequency of the gck polymorphism.	-1
germline mutation prevalence in individuals with pancreatic cancer and a history of previous malignancy.  approximately 10% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (pc) cases are attributed to hereditary causes. individuals with pc and a personal history of another cancer associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (hboc) or lynch syndrome (ls) may be more likely to carry germline mutations. participants with pc and a history of cancer were selected from a pancreatic disease registry. of 1296 individuals with pc, 149 had a relevant history of cancer. if banked dna was available, a multigene panel was performed for individuals who had not 1) previously had a mutation identified through clinical testing or 2) undergone clinical multigene panel testing with no mutations detected. twenty-two of 124 individuals with pc and another hboc- or ls-related cancer who underwent genetic testing had a mutation identified in a pc susceptibility gene (18%). if prostate cancer is excluded, the mutation prevalence increased to 23% (21/93). mutation carriers were more likely to have more than 1 previous cancer diagnosis (p = .001), to have had clinical genetic testing (p = .001), and to meet national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) genetic testing criteria (p < .001). approximately 23% of mutation carriers did not meet nccn hboc or ls testing guidelines based on their personal cancer history and reported cancer history in first-degree relatives. at least 18% of individuals with pc and a personal history of other hboc- or ls-related cancers carry mutations in a pc susceptibility gene based on our data, suggesting that criteria for genetic testing in individuals with pc should include consideration of previous cancer history. cancer 2018;124:1691-700.  2018 american cancer society.	-1
the missense p.s231f phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutation causes complete loss of enzymatic activity in vitro.  phenylketonuria (pku), the most frequent disorder of amino acid metabolism, is caused by mutations in human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah), leading to deficient enzyme activity. previously reported but uncharacterized pah gene mutation, p.s231f (c.692c > t), was detected in serbian patients with classical pku. we analyzed p.s231f pah protein in prokaryotic (escherichia coli) and eukaryotic expression system (hepatoma cells). in both systems the mutant enzyme was unstable. residual enzyme activity in vitro was approximately 1%. mutation p.s231f pah was not activated by pre-incubation with phenylalanine substrate. we found no groel/groes chaperone effect and slightly positive effect of the (6r)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) on the stabilization of the protein structure. our findings were in accordance with severe patients' phenotypes. in conclusion, p.s231f should be classified as a functionally null pah gene mutation as it drastically reduces stability and activity of the pah enzyme in vitro.	1
diverse driving forces underlie the invariant occurrence of the t42a, e139d, i282v and t468m shp2 amino acid substitutions causing noonan and leopard syndromes.  missense ptpn11 mutations cause noonan and leopard syndromes (ns and ls), two developmental disorders with pleiomorphic phenotypes. ptpn11 encodes shp2, an sh2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer. generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced. for a few codons, only one substitution is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced. we analyzed the biochemical behavior and ligand-binding properties of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the t42a, e139d and i282v substitutions in ns and the y279c and t468m changes in ls. our data demonstrate that the isoleucine-to-valine change at codon 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability of shp2's closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the threonine-to-alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide-binding affinity. the recognition specificity of the c-sh2 domain bearing the e139d substitution differed substantially from its wild-type counterpart acquiring binding properties similar to those observed for the n-sh2 domain, revealing a novel mechanism of shp2's functional dysregulation. finally, while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the t468m change in ls.	1
the sensitivity of exome sequencing in identifying pathogenic mutations for lgmd in the united states.  the current study characterizes a cohort of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (lgmd) in the united states using whole-exome sequencing. fifty-five families affected by lgmd were recruited using an institutionally approved protocol. exome sequencing was performed on probands and selected parental samples. pathogenic mutations and cosegregation patterns were confirmed by sanger sequencing. twenty-two families (40%) had novel and previously reported pathogenic mutations, primarily in lgmd genes, and also in genes for duchenne muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, myofibrillar myopathy, inclusion body myopathy and pompe disease. one family was diagnosed via clinical testing. dominant mutations were identified in col6a1, col6a3, flnc, lmna, ryr1, smchd1 and vcp, recessive mutations in ano5, capn3, gaa, lama2, sgca and sgcg, and x-linked mutations in dmd. a previously reported variant in dmd was confirmed to be benign. exome sequencing is a powerful diagnostic tool for lgmd. despite careful phenotypic screening, pathogenic mutations were found in other muscle disease genes, largely accounting for the increased sensitivity of exome sequencing. our experience suggests that broad sequencing panels are useful for these analyses because of the phenotypic overlap of many neuromuscular conditions. the confirmation of a benign dmd variant illustrates the potential of exome sequencing to help determine pathogenicity.	-1
a diverse array of cancer-associated mtor mutations are hyperactivating and can predict rapamycin sensitivity.  genes encoding components of the pi3k-akt-mtor signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer, but few mutations have been characterized in mtor, the gene encoding the mtor kinase. using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mtor pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 mtor mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. the mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the c-terminal half of mtor and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. the activating mutations do not affect mtor complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mtor inhibitor deptor. mtor complex 1 (mtorc1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mtor inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. finally, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating mtor mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mtor pathway dependency.	1
expanding the clinical spectrum of late-onset pompe disease: dilated arteriopathy involving the thoracic aorta, a novel vascular phenotype uncovered.  cerebro-vascular arteriopathy has been reported in late-onset pompe disease (lopd). evidence of increased aortic stiffness in some patients and smooth muscle involvement in lopd raises the possibility of aortic involvement. our aim was to determine if aortic arteriopathy may be a complication of lopd. one patient with lopd was diagnosed with aortic dilatation at duke metabolic clinic, 4 others were diagnosed at university of mainz, germany, where chest x-ray and echocardiography are routinely done for patients. other causes of aortic vascular disease were assessed. we report evidence of dilated arteriopathy involving primarily the ascending thoracic aorta in 5 females with late-onset pompe disease. one patient had a bicuspid aortic valve and developed dissection. another patient with juvenile onset disease had both thoracic and basilar artery aneurysms. aneurysmal dilatation of the thoracic aorta is an underreported vascular complication of lopd, probably due to the same pathological process that occurs in the brain. chest x-ray together with echocardiography should be incorporated as initial screening tools for aortic aneurysms in patients with lopd. when ectasia is suspected, or the ascending aorta is not visualized, contrast- mediated thoracic ct or mra may be necessary. large-scale studies are warranted to determine the prevalence and extent of aortic vascular involvement.	-1
clinical features of familial hypercholesterolemia in korea: predictors of pathogenic mutations and coronary artery disease - a study supported by the korean society of lipidology and atherosclerosis.  proper screening and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is of critical importance for cardiovascular prevention. however, the clinical diagnosis of fh remains difficult partly because its phenotype can vary between different ethnicities. the aim of this study was to determine the clinical features and the best diagnostic approach in korean fh patients. the predictors of putative pathogenic mutations and coronary artery disease (cad) were also identified. ninety-seven patients with low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol >190 mg/dl and xanthoma or fh-compatible family history were included. putative pathogenic mutations in ldlr, apob, or pcsk9 genes were identified in 32% of the enrolled patients. the subjects were classified according to four sets of clinical criteria (simon broome, dutch, medped, japanese). the mutation rates in definite type fh of simon broome or dutch criteria were 35%-37% and lower in our patients than in those of other countries. the mutation detection rate by medped criteria was 67%-75% and higher than those based on other criteria. the best low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ldl-c) threshold for predicting mutations was 225 mg/dl. ldl-c was found to be the only independent predictor of mutation carriers, while hypertension and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were predictive of cad. the conventional clinical criteria showed limited mutation detection power and low specificities in korean fh patients, in whom the best ldl-c threshold for putative mutation was 225 mg/dl. traditional cardiovascular risk factors were also significantly associated with cad risk in this population.	-1
a preliminary mutation analysis of phenylketonuria in southwest iran.  phenylketonuria (pku) is a heterogeneous and autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in the hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. this study was designed to identify pah mutations within exons 6, 7, and 10-12 in pku patients from southwest iran. forty iranian patients with clinical and biochemically confirmed pku were enrolled. the exons were sequenced directly and 13 different mutations were identified including i224t, s231p, r176x, c.592_613del22, r243x, r252w, r261q, y356x, v388m, ivs10-11g>a, ivs11+1g>c, ivs11-2a>g, and q375r, which were associated with 23 genotypes. a novel sequence variant, q375r (c.1124a>g), was detected in exon 11. in one patient, a typical genotype with more than two mutations (r243x/s231p/s231p) was found. seven different polymorphisms and three new variants were also detected in intron regions of pah. a high mutation spectrum was predicted in the southwestern region of iran due to its ethnic heterogeneity, especially the khuzestan province. the detection of 13 different mutations, corresponding to a mutation detection rate of 53.75%, confirmed this phenomenon.	-1
in vitro and in vivo correlations for i65t and m1v mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus.  mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus are the major cause of hyperphenylalaninemia. we have previously described four mutations (m1v, ivs12nt1, r408w, and s349p) at the pah locus in french canadians with ancestry in eastern quebec. here we report (1) identification of another mutation, on a haplotype 9 chromosome, which converts codon 65 from isoleucine (att) to threonine (act), (2) expression analysis of the i65t mutation in cos cells demonstrating 75% loss of both immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity, and (3) expression analysis of the most prevalent pku allele (m1v) in eastern quebec, showing nondetectable levels of pah protein and activity, a finding compatible with a mutation in the translation initiation codon. homozygosity for m1v and codominant inheritance of i65t/r408w were both associated with classical phenylketonuria.	1
abnormalities of cerebral arteries are frequent in patients with late-onset pompe disease.  cerebral aneurysms and arteropathies causing severe cerebrovascular events have been reported as rare complications in patients with late-onset pompe disease. we investigated the frequency of cerebrovascular anomalies in six patients with late-onset pompe disease followed at our institution. clinical data collection and magnetic resonance angiography were performed as part of routine annual examinations. four out of six patients had brain vascular anomalies including dolichoectasia of the basilar artery and ectasia of internal carotids. these patients also complained of gastrointestinal symptoms (chronic constipation and gastrointestinal reflux). two patients had clinical signs related to the arteriopathy, including partial paralysis of the third cranial nerve and transient ischemic attacks. at 1 year follow-up, enzyme replacement therapy did not modify the size of cerebral vessels, but patients reported a marked improvement of intestinal symptoms. in conclusion, neurologists should be aware that intracranial artery abnormalities are not infrequent in patients with late-onset pompe disease, and they should be specifically investigated in the presence of unexplained cns symptoms.	-1
a family with fabry disease diagnosed by a single angiokeratoma.  this case presents a 39-year-old gentleman with a single angiokeratoma on the abdomen. because of a family history of early onset cardiac disease, testing for fabry disease was performed and a mis-sense mutation (a143t) in the fabry gene confirmed the diagnosis. the unusual aspect of this case is that the patient otherwise had normal health. his only detectable abnormality was a high serum creatinine at 116 mmol/l. two further affected males and four carrier females were detected on family screening. we tested a further five patients with a single angiokeratoma for fabry disease. in the five tested though, no suggestive personal or family history was given for any of the patients and no further cases were detected. this case highlights the need for vigilance within dermatology clinics to consider fabry disease even if a solitary angiokeratoma is the only presenting feature. some patients do display a milder phenotype and thus a detailed family history should always be taken. as in this case, a solitary angiokeratoma and a suspicious family history may be the only clue. because enzyme replacement therapy is now available, the potential benefits for the patient and their family are high.	-1
mutations in the abcc8 gene can cause autoantibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes.  activating mutations in genes kcnj11 and abcc8, which form the atp-sensitive k+channel (k(atp) channel), have been shown to cause transient or permanent neonatal diabetes. we describe here a rather different phenotype: two cases of adult diabetic patients-considered and treated as insulin-dependent diabetic patients since adolescence-who, in fact, turned out to be heterozygous for an abcc8 mutation and able to successfully discontinue insulin while taking sulphonylurea treatment.	-1
a new common mutation in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene in finnish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  in the nationwide finhcm study including 306 finnish patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), we have previously identified two founder mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin (tpm1-d175n) and myosin-binding protein c (mybpc3-q1061x) genes, accounting for 18% of all cases. objective. to screen additional mutations, previously identified in eastern finnish cohorts with hcm, in the finhcm study population. ten mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene (myh7), tpm1, and mybpc3 were screened. myh7-r1053q was found in 17 of 306 patients (5.6%). no carriers of myh7-r719w or n696s were found. a novel tpm1-d175g mutation was found in a single patient. mybpc3 mutations were found in 14 patients: ivs5-2a-c in two, ivs14-13g-a in two, k811del in six, and a851inst in four patients. altogether, a hcm-causing mutation was identified in 32 patients, accounting for 10.5% of all cases. in addition, two mybpc3 variants r326q and v896m with uncertain pathogenicity were found in eight and in 10 patients, respectively. combining the present findings with our previous results, a causative mutation was identified in 28% of the finhcm cohort. myh7-r1053q was the third most common mutation, and should be screened in all new cases of hcm in finland.	-1
nuclear excluded autism-associated phosphatase and tensin homolog mutations dysregulate neuronal growth.  phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) negatively regulates downstream protein kinase b signaling, resulting in decreased cellular growth and proliferation. pten is mutated in a subset of children with autism spectrum disorder (asd); however, the mechanism by which specific point mutations alter pten function is largely unknown. here, we assessed how asd-associated single-nucleotide variations in pten (asd-pten) affect function. we used viral-mediated molecular substitution of human pten into pten knockout mouse neurons and assessed neuronal morphology to determine the functional impact of asd-pten. we employed molecular cloning to examine how pten's stability, subcellular localization, and catalytic activity affect neuronal growth. we identified a set of asd-pten mutations displaying altered lipid phosphatase function and subcellular localization. we demonstrated that wild-type pten can rescue the neuronal hypertrophy, while pten h93r, f241s, d252g, w274l, n276s, and d326n failed to rescue this hypertrophy. a subset of these mutations lacked nuclear localization, prompting us to examine the role of nuclear pten in regulating neuronal growth. we found that nuclear pten alone is sufficient to regulate soma size. furthermore, forced localization of the d252g and w274l mutations into the nucleus partially restores regulation of soma size. asd-pten mutations display decreased stability, catalytic activity, and/or altered subcellular localization. mutations lacking nuclear localization uncover a novel mechanism whereby lipid phosphatase activity in the nucleus can regulate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and neuronal growth.	1
contribution of slc26a4 to the molecular diagnosis of nonsyndromic prelingual sensorineural hearing loss in a brazilian cohort.  hereditary hearing loss (hl) is the most common sensorineural disorder in humans. besides mutations in gjb2 and gjb6 genes, pathogenic variants in the slc26a4 gene have been reported as a cause of hereditary hl due to its role in the physiology of the inner ear. in this research we wanted to investigate the prevalence of mutations in slc26a4 in brazilian patients with nonsyndromic prelingual sensorineural hl. we applied the high-resolution melting technique to screen 88 dna samples from unrelated deaf individuals that were previously screened for gjb2, gjb6 and mt-rnr1 mutations. the frequency of mutations in the slc26a4 gene was 28.4%. two novel mutations were found: p.ile254val and p.asn382lys. the mutation c.-66c>g (rs17154282) in the promoter region of slc26a4, was the most frequent mutation found and was significantly associated with nonsyndromic prelingual sensorineural hl. after mutations in the gjb2, gjb6 and mitochondrial genes, slc26a4 mutations are considered the next most common cause of hereditary hl in brazilian as well as in other populations, which corroborates with our data. furthermore, we suggest the inclusion of the scl26a4 gene in the investigation of hereditary hl since there was an increase in the frequency of the mutations found, up to 22.7%.	-1
a novel splice-site mutation in the gjb2 gene causing mild postlingual hearing impairment.  the dfnb1 subtype of autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic hearing impairment, caused by mutations affecting the gjb2 (connexin-26) [corrected] gene, is highly prevalent in most populations worldwide. dfnb1 hearing impairment is mostly severe or profound and usually appears before the acquisition of speech (prelingual onset), though a small number of hypomorphic missense mutations result in mild or moderate deafness of postlingual onset. we identified a novel gjb2 splice-site mutation, c. -22-2a>c, in three siblings with mild postlingual hearing impairment that were compound heterozygous for c. -22-2a>c and c.35delg. reverse transcriptase-pcr experiments performed on total rna extracted from saliva samples from one of these siblings confirmed that c. -22-2a>c abolished the acceptor splice site of the single gjb2 intron, resulting in the absence of normally processed transcripts from this allele. however, we did isolate transcripts from the c. -22-2a>c allele that keep an intact gjb2 coding region and that were generated by use of an alternative acceptor splice site previously unknown. the residual expression of wild-type connexin-26 [corrected] encoded by these transcripts probably underlies the mild severity and late onset of the hearing impairment of these subjects.	1
genetic analysis carried out on blood-spots of phenylalanine hydroxylase-deficient newborns detected by northeastern italian neonatal screening.  the aim of this work was to perform genetic analysis on 18 different blood-spot samples collected from neonates detected as hyperphenylalaninemic by northeastern italian screening program. dna was extracted from blood-spots. exons/introns of pah gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and pcr products were purified and sequenced with both forward and reverse primers. the most frequent mutations were ivs12nt1g>a (16.7%) and r408w, p281l and l48s (all together 11.1%). as expected, compound heterozygosity was the usual finding; homozygosity was found only in two patients with r158q and ivs2nt5g>c mutations. the v230i mutation was reported for the first time in italy. we found six previously described polymorphisms (v245v, ivs4nt47c>t, ivs2nt19t>c, ivs3nt-22c>t, ivs5nt-54a>g, and e280>q280). to our knowledge, four genotypes were not previously described: r158q/v230i present in one patient with classical pku; and l48s/r408q, a403v/ivs2nt-13t>g, and g272x/v230i present in patients showing hpa phenotype. most of the mutations were located in the exons 12 and 7 and in exon/intron 2 (83.3% detection of total mutations in pku or hpa patients of northeastern italy). from a practical viewpoint, the genetic analysis of blood-spots collected on guthrie cards for neonatal screening for pku could be a simple method to establish the genotype of neonates. consequently, the genotype/phenotype correlation could lead to a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis for families.	-1
molecular apocrine differentiation is a common feature of breast cancer in patients with germline pten mutations.  breast carcinoma is the main malignant tumor occurring in patients with cowden disease, a cancer-prone syndrome caused by germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene pten characterized by the occurrence throughout life of hyperplastic, hamartomatous and malignant growths affecting various organs. the absence of known histological features for breast cancer arising in a pten-mutant background prompted us to explore them for potential new markers. we first performed a microarray study of three tumors from patients with cowden disease in the context of a transcriptomic study of 74 familial breast cancers. a subsequent histological and immunohistochemical study including 12 additional cases of cowden disease breast carcinomas was performed to confirm the microarray data. unsupervised clustering of the 74 familial tumors followed the intrinsic gene classification of breast cancer except for a group of five tumors that included the three cowden tumors. the gene expression profile of the cowden tumors shows considerable overlap with that of a breast cancer subgroup known as molecular apocrine breast carcinoma, which is suspected to have increased androgenic signaling and shows frequent erbb2 amplification in sporadic tumors. the histological and immunohistochemical study showed that several cases had apocrine histological features and expressed ggt1, which is a potential new marker for apocrine breast carcinoma. these data suggest that activation of the erbb2-pi3k-akt pathway by loss of pten at early stages of tumorigenesis promotes the formation of breast tumors with apocrine features.	-1
the type and the position of hnf1a mutation modulate age at diagnosis of diabetes in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody)-3.  the clinical expression of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody)-3 is highly variable. this may be due to environmental and/or genetic factors, including molecular characteristics of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (hnf1a) gene mutation. we analyzed the mutations identified in 356 unrelated mody3 patients, including 118 novel mutations, and searched for correlations between the genotype and age at diagnosis of diabetes. missense mutations prevailed in the dimerization and dna-binding domains (74%), while truncating mutations were predominant in the transactivation domain (62%). the majority (83%) of the mutations were located in exons 1- 6, thus affecting the three hnf1a isoforms. age at diagnosis of diabetes was lower in patients with truncating mutations than in those with missense mutations (18 vs. 22 years, p = 0.005). missense mutations affecting the dimerization/dna-binding domains were associated with a lower age at diagnosis than those affecting the transactivation domain (20 vs. 30 years, p = 10(-4)). patients with missense mutations affecting the three isoforms were younger at diagnosis than those with missense mutations involving one or two isoforms (p = 0.03). these data show that part of the variability of the clinical expression in mody3 patients may be explained by the type and the location of hnf1a mutations. these findings should be considered in studies for the search of additional modifier genetic factors.	-1
pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a germline pten p.arg234gln mutation.  a minor fraction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pdac) develops in association with germline mutations of the genes responsible for inherited cancer syndromes. however, the pdac that has a germline pten mutation has not received much attention. genome-wide whole exome sequencing was performed on germline and somatic dna from an 82-year-old woman who had developed a solid pancreatic cancer but did not show characteristic findings of pten hamartoma tumor syndromes (phts). histology of the resected pancreatic tumor showed unique pdac findings of primarily dendriform structures and dense fibrous tissue, accompanied by multiple pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in the vicinity. the tumor immunohistochemistry revealed a loss of pten expression and overexpression of tp53. exome sequencing revealed a k-ras mutation (p.gly12val). germline exome sequencing revealed a missense mutation of pten (p.arg234gln), a rare variant with a reported association with cancer development but not with other phts phenotypes. to our knowledge, this is the first report of pdac associated with a germline pten mutation, particularly a rare variant (p.arg234gln) with cancer risks.	-1
[in vitro expression study of novel mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene].  to study the in vitro expression of 6 novel missense mutations (r270g, p275a, f121l, a156p, e183g, i324n) and a previously described r408q mutation of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene and explore the genotype-phenotype correlation through comparison of protein levels and residual enzyme activities. seven expression vectors containing pah cdna were constructed with a site-directed mutagenesis kit. the plasmids were extracted and sequenced to confirm the target mutations. pcdna3.0 containing pah cdna was transfected into cos-7 cells and total proteins were extracted 48 h after transfection. the quantities of proteins and residual enzyme activities of the 7 mutants were assessed with the wild-type pah gene as reference. relative quantities of pah proteins for r270g, p275a, f121l, a156p, e183g, i324n and r408q were 10.5%, 56.6%, 54.3%, 8.7%, 8.5%, 67.3% and 85.4%, respectively. the residual enzyme activities were 7.7%, 27.6%, 19.0%, 10.4%, 9.1%, 50.6% and 40.2%, respectively. pah residual enzyme activities of 7 pah mutants were all significantly reduced.	1
evidence that the v832m e-cadherin germ-line missense mutation does not influence the affinity of alpha -catenin for the cadherin/catenin complex.  mutations in e-cadherin are associated with a number of diseases, and have been shown to contribute to disease progression. in particular, 50% of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer cases have inactivating mutations in the e-cadherin gene. an interesting mutation near the beta-catenin-binding site on the cytoplasmic domain of e-cadherin (v832m) was recently reported that produces full-length protein, but exhibits decreased binding of alpha -catenin to the cadherin/catenin complex. the study was done by transfecting mutant e-cadherin into chinese hamster ovary fibroblast cells. here we show that the previously reported characteristics of this mutation do not apply to human epithelial cells expressing this mutant protein and suggest that the mechanism whereby the v832m mutation in human e-cadherin promotes gastric cancer is not yet understood.	1
molecular epidemiology and genotype-phenotype correlation in phenylketonuria patients from south spain.  the aim of this study was to identify the most common genotypes in the phenylketonuria (pku) population of andalusia, assessing the correlation with the phenotype and the usefulness in predicting the response to treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin. we conducted a retrospective observational study between january 1980 and january 2010 in 147 andalusian pku patients assessing phenotype, genotype and response to a 24-h bh4 loading test. our cohort of patients exhibited 65 different mutations, 69.2% corresponding to the missense type, in a total of 123 different genotypes. ivs10nt-11g>a was the most common mutation (10.9%). four novel missense mutations were identified: p.l258p; p.e66k, p.r155c and p.p122s. although generally there is a good genotype-phenotype correlation, for eight of the repeated genotypes a slightly different phenotype was observed. in 96 pku subjects bh4 challenge was carried out. patients with previously reported unresponsive mutations on both alleles showed a negative response, while 95.5% (28/29) of the responsive patients carry at least one missense mutation previously associated to the bh4. our data reveal a great genetic heterogeneity in the andalusian population. genotype is quite a good predictor of the phenotype and of the responsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin, which is relevant for patient management and follow-up.	1
phenylketonuria: genotype-phenotype correlations based on expression analysis of structural and functional mutations in pah.  when analyzed in the context of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) three-dimensional structure, only a minority of the pku mutations described world-wide affect catalytic residues. consistent with these observations, recent data point to defective folding and subsequent aggregation/degradation as a predominant disease mechanism for several mutations. in this work, we use a combined approach of expression in eukaryotic cells at different temperatures and a prokaryotic system with co-expression of chaperonins to elucidate and confirm structural consequences for 18 pku mutations. three mutations are located in the amino terminal regulatory domain and 15 in the catalytic domain. four mutations were found to abolish the specific activity in all conditions. two are catalytic mutations (y277d and e280k) and two are severe structural defects (ivs10-11g>a and l311p). all the remaining mutations (d59y, i65t, e76g, p122q, r158q, g218v, r243q, p244l, r252w, r261q, a309v, r408q, r408w, and y414c) are folding defects causing reduced stability and accelerated degradation, although some of them probably affect residues involved in regulation. in these cases, we have demonstrated that the amount of mutant pah protein and residual activity could be modulated by in vitro experimental conditions, and therefore the observed in vivo metabolic variation may be explained by interindividual variation in the quality control systems. the results derived provide an experimental framework to define the mutation severity relating genotype to phenotype. they also explain the observed inconsistencies for some mutations in patients with similar genotype and different phenotypes.	1
concurrent genetic and standard screening for hearing impairment in 9317 southern chinese newborns.  the goal of this study was to investigate the use of concurrent genetic screening together with standard newborn hearing screening (nhs) in an effort to provide a scientific basis for the beneficial use of concurrent genetic hearing screening in newborns. our aim was to improve the neonatal detection rate of hearing impairment and the potential for hearing loss, allowing for increased early intervention and potentially allowing for prevention of later onset hearing loss. this information could also be used to increase the effectiveness of genetic counseling regarding hearing impairment. a total of 9317 neonates from children's hospital of dongguan and dongguan people's hospital were included in this study between january 2015 and october 2015. twenty hotspot hearing-associated mutations of four common deafness- susceptibility genes (gjb2, gjb3, slc26a4, and mtrnr1) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms). the results of genetic screening and nhs were concurrently analyzed. a total of 129 infants (1.38%) exhibited hearing loss as determined by otoacoustic emission (oae) testing. the genetic screening revealed that 348 (3.74%) individuals had at least one mutant allele. in total, 34 (0.36%) of the neonates carried a causal complement of mutations. the overwhelming majority of the genetically referred newborns passed the oae hearing screening, but could be at risk for later hearing loss. this study furthers the understanding of the etiology of hearing loss and proves that it is beneficial to use genetic screening along with oae screening of neonates to improve detection rates of at-risk infants. our results show that this concurrent testing allows for better early identification of infants at risk for hearing loss, which may occur before speech and language development. prevention of hearing loss can be achieved by avoiding the use of antibiotics containing amino glycosides in infants whose mutations make them extremely sensitive to these antibiotics. this information is also useful in genetic counseling, providing region-specific mutation information.	-1
genetic mutations of gjb2 and mitochondrial 12s rrna in nonsyndromic hearing loss in jiangsu province of china.  hearing loss is caused by several environmental and genetic factors and the proportion attributed to inherited causes is assumed at 50 ~ 60% . mutations in gjb2 and mitochondrial dna (mtdna) 12s rrna are the most common molecular etiology for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (nshl). the mutation spectra of these genes vary among different ethnic groups. to add the molecular etiologic information of hearing loss in the chinese population, a total of 658 unrelated patients with nshl from jiangsu province of china were selected for mutational screening including gjb2 and mtdna 12s rrna genes using pcr and dna sequencing technology. as for controls, 462 normal-hearing individuals were collected. a total of 9 pathogenic mutations in the gjb2 and 7 pathogenic mutations in the 12s rrna gene were identified. of all patients, 70 had monoallelic gjb2 coding region mutation in the heterozygous state, 94 carried two confirmed pathogenic mutations including 79 homozygotes and 15 compound heterozygotes. the 235delc appears to be the most common deafness-causing gjb2 mutation (102/658, 15.50% ). no mutations or variants in the gjb2 exon1 and basal promoter region were found. in these patients, 4 subjects carried the m.1494c > t mutation (0.61% ) and 39 subjects harbored the m.1555a > g mutation (5.93% ) in mtdna 12s rrna gene. a novel sequence variant at m.1222a > g in the 12s rrna gene was identified, which could alter the secondary structure of the 12s rrna. the mutation spectrum and prevalence of gjb2 and mtdna 12s rrna genes in jiangsu population are similar to other areas of china. there are in total 31.46% of the patients with nshl carry deafness-causing mutation in gjb2 or mtdna 12s rrna genes. mutation in gjb2 gene is the most common factor, mtdna 12s rrna also plays an important part in the pathogenesis of hearing loss in jiangsu province areas. the m.1222a > g was found to be a new candidate mutation associated with hearing loss. our results indicated the necessity of genetic screening for mutations of these genes in jiangsu patients with nshl.	-1
long-term follow-up and outcome of phenylketonuria patients on sapropterin: a retrospective study.  sapropterin dihydrochloride, the synthetic form of 6r-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), is an approved drug for the treatment of patients with bh4-responsive phenylketonuria (pku). the purpose of this study was to assess genotypes and data on the long-term effects of bh4/sapropterin on metabolic control and patient-related outcomes in 6 large european countries. a questionnaire was developed to assess phenotype, genotype, blood phenylalanine (phe) levels, phe tolerance, quality of life, mood changes, and adherence to diet in pku patients from 16 medical centers. one hundred forty-seven patients, of whom 41.9% had mild hyperphenylalaninemia, 50.7% mild pku, and 7.4% classic pku, were followed up over ?12 years. a total of 85 different genotypes were reported. with the exception of two splice variants, all of the most common mutations were reported to be associated with substantial residual phe hydroxylase activity. median phe tolerance increased 3.9 times with bh4/sapropterin therapy, compared with dietary treatment, and median phe blood concentrations were within the therapeutic range in all patients. compared with diet alone, improvement in quality of life was reported in 49.6% of patients, improvement in adherence to diet was reported in 47% of patients, and improvement in adherence to treatment was reported in 63.3% of patients. no severe adverse events were reported. our data document a long-term beneficial effect of orally administered bh4/sapropterin in responsive pku patients by improving the metabolic control, increasing daily tolerance for dietary phe intake, and for some, by improving dietary adherence and quality of life. patient genotypes help in predicting bh4 responsiveness.	-1
familial hypercholesterolemia in st-petersburg: the known and novel mutations found in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene in russia.  familial hypercholesterolemia is a human monogenic disease caused by population-specific mutations in the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor gene. despite thirteen different mutations of the ldl receptor gene were reported from russia prior to 2003, the whole spectrum of disease-causing gene alterations in this country is poorly known and requires further investigation provided by the current study. forty-five patients with clinical diagnosis of fh were tested for the apolipoprotein b (apob) mutation r3500q by restriction fragment length analysis. after exclusion of r3500q mutation high-sensitive fluorescent single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis and automatic dna sequencing were used to search for mutations in the ldl receptor gene. we found twenty one rare sequence variations of the ldl receptor gene. nineteen were probably pathogenic mutations, and two (p518p, t705i) were considered as neutral ones. among the mutations likely to be pathogenic, eight were novel (c.670-671insg, c249x, c.936-940del5, c.1291-1331del41, w422x, c.1855-1856insa, d601n, c646s), and eleven (q12x, ivs3+1g>a, c.651-653del3, e207x, c.925-931del7, c308y, l380h, c.1302delg, ivs9+1g>a, v776m, v806i) have already been described in other populations. none of the patients had the r3500q mutation in the apob gene. nineteen pathogenic mutations in the ldl receptor gene in 23 probands were identified. two mutations c.925-931del7 and l380h are shared by st.-petersburg population with neighbouring finland and several other mutations with norway, sweden or denmark, i.e. countries from the baltic sea region. only four mutations (c.313+1g>a, c.651-653del3, c308y and w422x) were recurrent as all those were found in two unrelated families. by this study the number of known mutations in the ldl receptor gene in st.-petersburg area was increased nearly threefold. analysis of all 34 low density lipoprotein receptor gene mutations found in st.-petersburg argues against strong founder effect in russian familial hypercholesterolemia.	-1
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation caused by arg663his beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain mutation.  more than 40 different beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (beta-mhc) missense mutations have been identified that cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc). some of these are recognized to have important clinical manifestations, such as an increased incidence of sudden death. we report that the beta-mhc missense mutation arg663his causes predominant cardiac morphology and atrial fibrillation. longitudinal clinical evaluations were performed in a kindred with fhc. the nucleotide sequence of the beta-mhc gene was analyzed to define the causal mutation. a missense mutation in the beta-mhc gene, arg663his, was identified in 24 individuals. clinical studies demonstrated modest left ventricular hypertrophy in affected individuals, predominantly localized in the proximal segment of the interventricular septum, which increased (average = 40 +/- 8%) during 7 years of follow-up. results showed that 47% of arg663his adults (age > 16 years) with ventricular hypertrophy developed atrial fibrillation, significantly more (p <0.001) than observed in ungenotyped fhc populations. survival of affected individuals remained near normal. the beta-mhc missense mutation arg663his causes a characteristic pattern of ventricular hypertrophy. arg663his individuals have a markedly higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation, compared with a population with ungenotyped hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the demonstration of phenotype as a direct consequence of genotype further extends the utility of molecular data in clinical medicine. early identification of arg663his individuals has the potential to minimize the serious sequelae of this arrhythmia in this fhc group.	-1
heterozygous abcc8 mutations are a cause of mody.  the abcc8 gene encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (sur1) subunit of the pancreatic beta cell atp-sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channel. inactivating mutations cause congenital hyperinsulinism (chi) and activating mutations cause transient neonatal diabetes (tndm) or permanent neonatal diabetes (pndm) that can usually be treated with sulfonylureas. sulfonylurea sensitivity is also a feature of hnf1a and hnf4a mody, but patients referred for genetic testing with clinical features of these types of diabetes do not always have mutations in the hnf1a/4a genes. our aim was to establish whether mutations in the abcc8 gene cause mody that is responsive to sulfonylurea therapy. we sequenced the abcc8 gene in 85 patients with a bmi <30 kg/m, no family history of neonatal diabetes and who were deemed sensitive to sulfonylureas by the referring clinician or were sulfonylurea-treated. all had tested negative for mutations in the hnf1a and hnf4a genes. abcc8 mutations were found in seven of the 85 (8%) probands. four patients were heterozygous for previously reported mutations and four novel mutations, e100k, g214r, q485r and n1245d, were identified. only four probands fulfilled mody criteria, with two diagnosed after 25 years and one patient, who had no family history of diabetes, as a result of a proven de novo mutation. abcc8 mutations can cause mody in patients whose clinical features are similar to those with hnf1a/4a mody. therefore, sequencing of abcc8 in addition to the known mody genes should be considered if such features are present, to facilitate optimal clinical management of these patients.	-1
ethnic-specific spectrum of gjb2 and slc26a4 mutations: their origin and a literature review.  the mutation spectrum of the gjb2 and slc26a4 genes, the 2 most common genes causing deafness, are known to be ethnic specific. in this study, the spectrum of the reported gjb2 and slc26a4 mutations in different populations are reviewed and considered from a human migration perspective. fifty-two and 17 articles on gjb2 and slc26a4 mutations, respectively, were reviewed through the pubmed database from april 1996 to september 2014. the 4 most prevalent mutations were selected and compared. a cluster analysis was subsequently performed for these selected mutations. the present review of frequent mutations shows the ethnic-specific gjb2 and slc26a4 gene mutation spectrum. a cluster analysis of the gjb2 and slc26a4 genes revealed similarities between ethnic populations. the mutation spectrum reviewed in this study clearly indicated that the frequent mutations in the gjb2 and slc26a4 genes are consistent with the founder mutation hypothesis. a comparison with the y-chromosome phylogenetic tree indicated that these mutations may have occurred during human migration.	-1
severe neonatal manifestations of costello syndrome.  costello syndrome (cs) is due to mutations in hras, with the most common mutation being c.34g>a (p.g12s), found in most patients in all the published series. a small number of less common mutations have been reported. hras mutation analysis has been undertaken in 74 predominantly british patients with a possible diagnosis of cs. a hras mutation was found in 27 patients, 15 of whom have been previously reported. phenotype analysis: four cases had an unusually severe phenotype, associated in three cases with two unusual mutations, c.35g>a, p.g12d in two cases and c.34g>t, p.g12c in the other. hypoglycaemia, renal abnormalities, severe early cardiomyopathy, congenital lung and airway abnormalities, pleural and pericardial effusion, chylous ascites and pulmonary lymphangectasia are confirmed as part of the clinical spectrum seen in cs. a lung pathology resembling alveolar capillary dysplasia is reported in one case. these cases illustrate that the diagnosis of cs may be difficult in the newborn period, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the sick newborn infant with multisystem disease. study of more cases will be required to establish if there is a definite association between severe disease and less common mutations.	-1
familial cases of atypical clinical features genetically diagnosed as leopard syndrome (multiple lentigines syndrome).  five familial cases exhibited ephelides-like multiple lentigines, and we examined three of them, a mother and two sons. all three patients presented with small dark-brown maculae on the face and neck and electrocardiographic abnormalities. these findings sufficed to fulfill the criteria for leopard syndrome (multiple lentigines syndrome), although they lacked five of seven major clinical features. however, the family members presented with a webbed neck and pectus excavatum, which are more frequently seen in turner or noonan syndrome. histological examination of the lentigines revealed slightly elongated rete ridges, a hyperpigmented basal layer, and melanophages in the papillary dermis. direct sequencing of the patients' genomic dna revealed that all three had a consistent missense mutation [c.1403c > t (p.t468m)] in the ptpn11 gene, confirming leopard syndrome with an atypical phenotype. it was suggested that leopard syndrome shows a diverse phenotype but its diagnosis can be verified by mutation analysis.	-1
several mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene including a nonsense and a frameshift mutation associated with dominantly inherited obesity in humans.  the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (mc4-r) has been implicated in weight regulation. recently, two independent groups reported frameshift mutations associated with a dominant form of obesity (1, 2). we screened the coding region of the mc4-r in 306 extremely obese children and adolescents (mean body mass index: bmi 34.4 +/- 6.6 kg/m2), 25 healthy underweight students (mean bmi 17.1 +/- 0.8 kg/m2), 52 normal weight individuals (mean bmi 22.0 +/- 1.0 kg/m2), 51 inpatients with anorexia nervosa (an, dsm iv criteria, mean bmi 14.3 +/- 1.5 kg/m2) and 27 patients with bulimia nervosa (bn, dsm iv criteria, mean bmi 21.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m2) by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (sscp). several mutations were identified, including the frameshift mutation described (1). the mutations were as follows: a) the deletion of 4 bp (delta of ctct at codon 211) results in a frameshift, thus rendering a truncated protein. this mutation has been assumed to be associated with dominantly-inherited morbid obesity in humans (1). both the index patient (bmi 42.06 kg/m2, height 171 cm, age 19.6 years) and her mother (bmi 37.55 kg/m2, height 164 cm, age 42.5 years) were heterozygous for the deletion. b) a nonsense mutation at position 35 of the mc4-r was detected in two obese probands (bmi 31.29 kg/m2 and bmi 45.91 kg/m2). this mutation leads to a truncated protein that encompasses the n-terminal extracellular domain. both carriers additionally showed (c) a missense mutation (asp-37-val). in both of these cases tyr-35-stop and asp-37-val were maternally transmitted, thus these variations form a haplotype. d) e) a male obese proband harbored two missense mutations (ser-30-phe, gly-252-ser). f)-i) four different missense mutations (pro-78-leu, thr-112-met, arg-165-trp, ile-317-thr) were detected in four different male probands, respectively. all of these mutations (a to i) were found solely in extremely obese individuals whose bmis were all above the 99th percentile. j) a silent mutation (c-579-t, val-193-val) was detected in a male underweight individual. k) a previously described polymorphism (val-103-ile; 3) was detected with similar frequencies in all different study groups. 1) we identified a novel polymorphism (ile-251-leu) with similar allele frequencies in all groups under study. in conclusion, our data indicate that mutations in the mc4-r are not uncommon. whereas our data support the evidence for dominantly inherited obesity as revealed by the three obese probands with haplo-insufficiency, the functional significance of the missense mutations remains to be determined.	-1
gjb2 and gjb6 mutations are an infrequent cause of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss in residents of mexico.  mutations in the dfnb1 locus are the most common cause of autosomal-recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss (arnshl) worldwide. the aim of this study was to identify the most frequent mutations in patients with arnshl who reside in northeastern mexico. we determined the nucleotide sequence the coding region of gjb2 of 78 patients with arnshl. polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect the gjb2 ivs1+1g>a mutation and deletions within gjb6. gjb2 mutations were detected in 9.6% of the alleles, and c.35delg was the most frequent. six other less-frequent mutations were detected, including an extremely rare variant (c.645_648deltaga), a novel mutation (c.35g>a), and one of possible mexican origin (c.34g>t). gjb6 deletions and gjb2 ivs1+1g>a were not detected. these data suggest that mutations in the dfnb1 locus are a rare cause of arnshl among the population of northeastern mexico. this confirms the genetic heterogeneity of this condition and indicates that further research is required to determine the other mechanisms of pathogenesis of arnshl in mexicans.	-1
mutation spectrum of the pah gene in the pku patients from khorasan razavi province of iran.  characterization of the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (pku) in north-east of iran has been accomplished through the analysis of 62 unrelated chromosomes from 31 iranian pku patients. phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations have been analyzed by direct dna sequencing exons 6, 7, 10 and 11. a mutation detection rate of 74% was achieved. eleven different mutations were found, with the most frequent mutation, ivs10-11g>a, accounting for 19% of khorasan-razavi pku alleles. ten mutations (r176x, e280k, ivs11+1g>c, s231p, q383x, r243x, i224t, e390g, r252w and p281l) represent the rest pku chromosomes. one novel mutation, q383x in the homozygote form was identified which is located in the catalytic domain (residues143-410). with this high detection rate of mutations in north-east of iran, new strategy for carrier testing could be dna sequencing of these four exons. the other exons and boundaries will be studied only when either one or no mutations are detected in the initial screen.	-1
malignant familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a family with a 453arg-->cys mutation in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene: coexistence of sudden death and end-stage heart failure.  recent genotype-phenotype correlation studies in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) have revealed that some mutations in the beta- myosin heavy chain (bmhc) gene may be associated with a high incidence of sudden death and a poor prognosis. coexistence of sudden death and end-stage heart failure in several families with fhc has recently being reported; however, the genetic basis of such families has not been clearly demonstrated. a three-generation chinese familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) family (family hli) with two cases of end-stage heart failure and three cases of sudden death was analyzed. the average age of death in the affected members in this family was 34 years old. genetic linkage analysis using polymorphisms in the (alpha- and beta-myosin heavy chain genes revealed that fhc in this family is significantly linked to the bmhc gene without recombinations. single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 8, 9 and 13 to 23 in the bmhc gene showed a polymorphic band on exon 14 that is in complete linkage with the disease status in this family. dna sequencing analysis in the affected members revealed an 453arg-->cys mutation in the bmhc gene. to our knowledge this is the first reported mutation of fhc in chinese. our data suggest that the 453arg-->cys mutation is associated with a malignant clinical course in fhc due not only to sudden death but also to end-stage heart failure.	-1
dna diagnostics of hereditary hearing loss: a targeted resequencing approach combined with a mutation classification system.  although there are nearly 100 different causative genes identified for nonsyndromic hearing loss (nshl), sanger sequencing-based dna diagnostics usually only analyses three, namely, gjb2, slc26a4, and otof. as this is seen as inadequate, there is a need for high-throughput diagnostic methods to detect disease-causing variations, including single-nucleotide variations (snvs), insertions/deletions (indels), and copy-number variations (cnvs). in this study, a targeted resequencing panel for hearing loss was developed including 79 genes for nshl and selected forms of syndromic hearing loss. one-hundred thirty one presumed autosomal-recessive nshl (arnshl) patients of western-european ethnicity were analyzed for snvs, indels, and cnvs. in addition, we established a straightforward variant classification system to deal with the large number of variants encountered. we estimate that combining prescreening of gjb2 with our panel leads to a diagnosis in 25%-30% of patients. our data show that after gjb2, the most commonly mutated genes in a western-european population are tmc1, myo15a, and myo7a (3.1%). cnv analysis resulted in the identification of causative variants in two patients in otoa and strc. one of the major challenges for diagnostic gene panels is assigning pathogenicity for variants. a collaborative database collecting all identified variants from multiple centers could be a valuable resource for hearing loss diagnostics.	-1
multiple malignancies in a child with de novo tp53 mutation.  the authors present the case of an 8.5-year-old boy diagnosed with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the infratemporal fossa at 21 months old. five years later he developed an osteosarcoma of the tibia, for which he was treated with standard chemotherapy and resection. soon after completing this treatment, ptosis of the right eye developed. a mass in the cavernous sinus was found, interpreted as an osteogenic metastatsis, although a third primary tumor could not be ruled out. molecular genetic investigation revealed a de novo germline tp53 mutation, and heralded an aggressive clinical progression of multiple malignancies in a child.	-1
the role of common and rare mc4r variants and fto polymorphisms in extreme form of obesity.  melanocortin 4 receptor (mc4r) is an important regulator of food intake and number of studies report genetic variations influencing the risk of obesity. here we explored the role of common genetic variation from mc4r locus comparing with snps from gene fto locus, as well as the frequency and functionality of rare mc4r mutations in cohort of 380 severely obese individuals (bmi > 39 kg/m(2)) and 380 lean subjects from the genome database of latvian population (lgdb). we found correlation for two snps--rs11642015 and rs62048402 in the fat mass and obesity-associated protein (fto) with obesity but no association was detected for rs17782313 located in the mc4r locus in these severely obese individuals. we sequenced the whole gene mc4r coding region in all study subjects and found five previously known heterozygous non-synonymous substitutions v103i, i121t, s127l, v166i and i251l. expression in mammalian cells showed that the s127l, v166i and double v103i/s127l mutant receptors had significantly decreased quantity at the cell surface compared to the wild type mc4r. we carried out detailed functional analysis of v166i that demonstrated that, despite low abundance in plasma membrane, the v166i variant has lower ec50 value upon ?msh activation than the wild type receptor, while the level of agrp inhibition was decreased, implying that v166i cause hyperactive satiety signalling. overall, this study suggest that s127l may be the most frequent functional mc4r mutation leading to the severe obesity in general population and provides new insight into the functionality of population based variants of the mc4r.	-1
a detailed clinical and molecular survey of subjects with nonsyndromic ush2a retinopathy reveals an allelic hierarchy of disease-causing variants.  defects in ush2a cause both isolated retinal disease and usher syndrome (ie, retinal disease and deafness). to gain insights into isolated/nonsyndromic ush2a retinopathy, we screened ush2a in 186 probands with recessive retinal disease and no hearing complaint in childhood (discovery cohort) and in 84 probands with recessive retinal disease (replication cohort). detailed phenotyping, including retinal imaging and audiological assessment, was performed in individuals with two likely disease-causing ush2a variants. further genetic testing, including screening for a deep-intronic disease-causing variant and large deletions/duplications, was performed in those with one likely disease-causing change. overall, 23 of 186 probands (discovery cohort) were found to harbour two likely disease-causing variants in ush2a. some of these variants were predominantly associated with nonsyndromic retinal degeneration ('retinal disease-specific'); these included the common c.2276 g>t, p.(cys759phe) mutation and five additional variants: c.2802 t>g, p.(cys934trp); c.10073 g>a, p.(cys3358tyr); c.11156 g>a, p.(arg3719his); c.12295-3 t>a; and c.12575 g>a, p.(arg4192his). an allelic hierarchy was observed in the discovery cohort and confirmed in the replication cohort. in nonsyndromic ush2a disease, retinopathy was consistent with retinitis pigmentosa and the audiological phenotype was variable. ush2a retinopathy is a common cause of nonsyndromic recessive retinal degeneration and has a different mutational spectrum to that observed in usher syndrome. the following model is proposed: the presence of at least one 'retinal disease-specific' ush2a allele in a patient with ush2a-related disease results in the preservation of normal hearing. careful genotype-phenotype studies such as this will become increasingly important, especially now that high-throughput sequencing is widely used in the clinical setting.	-1
phenylketonuria in costa rica: preliminary spectrum of pah mutations and their associations with highly polymorphic haplotypes.  a preliminary evaluation of the molecular basis of phenylketonuria (pku) in costa rica was made by performing mutational analyses in the six pku families identified to date. these studies revealed the presence of the previously reported european mutations ivs1nt5, l48s, e221g and ivs12ntl as well as the novel mutation ivs7nt3. the combined use of the str, vntr and xmni polymorphic systems for the pah gene resulted in a discriminant distribution of haplotypes among normal and mutant chromosomes and suggests its potential usefulness for future diagnostic applications in costa rican pku kindreds. this is the first report of a genetic analysis in a central american pku population.	-1
molecular genetics of the ldl receptor gene in familial hypercholesterolemia.  the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor is a cell surface transmembrane protein that mediates the uptake and lysosomal degradation of plasma ldl, thereby providing cholesterol to cells. mutations disrupting the function of this receptor produce autosomal dominant familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). affected individuals have elevated plasma levels of ldl, which causes premature coronary atherosclerosis. to date, 71 mutations in the ldl receptor gene have been characterized at a molecular level. in this report, we describe 79 additional mutations and review the insights that all 150 mutations have provided into the structure/function relationship of the receptor protein and the clinical manifestations of fh.	1
the impact of antibodies on clinical outcomes in diseases treated with therapeutic protein: lessons learned from infantile pompe disease.  enzyme replacement therapy with rhgaa (myozyme) has lead to improved survival, which is largely attributable to improvements in cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle function. however, crossreactive immunologic material-negative patients have a poor clinical response to enzyme replacement therapy secondary to high sustained antibody titers. furthermore, although the majority of crossreactive immunologic material-positive patients tolerize or experience a downtrend in anti-rhgaa antibody titers, antibody response is variable with some crossreactive immunologic material-positive infants also mounting high sustained antibody titers. we retrospectively analyzed 34 infants with pompe disease: 11 crossreactive immunologic material-negative patients, nine high-titer crossreactive immunologic material-positive patients, and 14 low-titer crossreactive immunologic material-positive patients. clinical outcome measures were overall survival, ventilator-free survival, left ventricular mass index, alberta infant motor scale score, and urine glc(4) levels. clinical outcomes in the high-titer crossreactive immunologic material-positive group were poor across all areas evaluated relative to the low-titer crossreactive immunologic material-positive group. for the crossreactive immunologic material-negative and high-titer crossreactive immunologic material-positive groups, no statistically significant differences were observed for any outcome measures, and both patient groups did poorly. our data indicate that, irrespective of crossreactive immunologic material status, patients with infantile pompe disease with high sustained antibody titer have an attenuated therapeutic response to enzyme replacement therapy. with the advent of immunomodulation therapies, identification of patients at risk for developing high sustained antibody titer is critical.	-1
high frequency of germline tp53 mutations in a prospective adult-onset sarcoma cohort.  sarcomas are a key feature of li-fraumeni and related syndromes (lfs/lfl), associated with germline tp53 mutations. current penetrance estimates for tp53 mutations are subject to significant ascertainment bias. the international sarcoma kindred study is a clinic-based, prospective cohort of adult-onset sarcoma cases, without regard to family history. the entire cohort was screened for mutations in tp53 using high-resolution melting analysis and sanger sequencing, and multiplex-ligation-dependent probe amplification and targeted massively parallel sequencing for copy number changes. pathogenic tp53 mutations were detected in blood dna of 20/559 sarcoma probands (3.6%); 17 were germline and 3 appeared to be somatically acquired. of the germline carriers, one appeared to be mosaic, detectable in the tumor and blood, but not epithelial tissues. germline mutation carriers were more likely to have multiple cancers (47% vs 15% for non-carriers, p = 3.010(-3)), and earlier cancer onset (33 vs 48 years, p = 1.1910(-3)). the median survival of mutation carriers following first cancer diagnosis was not significantly different from non-carriers. only 10/17 (59%) pedigrees met classical or chompret criteria for lfs. in summary, germline tp53 mutations are not rare in adult patients with sarcoma, with implications for screening, surveillance, treatment and genetic counselling of carriers and family members.	-1

lack of correlation between p53-dependent transcriptional activity and the ability to induce apoptosis among 179 mutant p53s.  tumor suppressor p53-dependent apoptosis is thought to be one of the most important tumor-suppressive functions in human tumorigenesis. however, whether the major mechanism underlying the p53-dependent apoptosis is transactivation dependent or independent remains unclear. using 179 mutant p53s with diverse transcriptional activities for distinct p53-binding sequences in yeast, we evaluated both their sequence-specific transcriptional activities on six p53 target genes and their ability to induce apoptosis in saos-2 cells. these mutant p53s also represented diversity in their ability to both transactivate target genes and induce apoptosis. we identified 17 mutant p53s with superior ability to induce apoptosis than wild-type p53 that tend to cluster at residues 121 or 290 to 292. there was no significant correlation between the two functional properties on any single target gene examined. furthermore, the 17 mutant p53s were not classified in a specific cluster by hierarchical cluster analysis on their diverse transcriptional activities, indicating that these mutant p53s were not similar in the transcriptional activity of downstream genes. these results suggested that transactivation-dependent apoptosis does not always play a major role in p53-dependent apoptosis, indirectly supporting the importance role of the transactivation-independent mechanism.	1
effect of enzyme therapy and prognostic factors in 69 adults with pompe disease: an open-label single-center study.  enzyme replacement therapy (ert) in adults with pompe disease, a progressive neuromuscular disorder, is of promising but variable efficacy. we investigated whether it alters the course of disease, and also identified potential prognostic factors. patients in this open-label single-center study were treated biweekly with 20 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa. muscle strength, muscle function, and pulmonary function were assessed every 3-6 months and analyzed using repeated-measures anova. sixty-nine patients (median age 52.1 years) were followed for a median of 23 months. muscle strength increased after start of ert (manual muscle testing 1.4 percentage points per year (pp/y); hand-held dynamometry 4.0 pp/y; both p < 0.001). forced vital capacity (fvc) remained stable when measured in upright, but declined in supine position (-1.1 pp/y; p = 0.03). muscle function did not improve in all patients (quick motor function test 0.7 pp/y; p = 0.14), but increased significantly in wheelchair-independent patients and those with mild and moderate muscle weakness.relative to the pre-treatment period (49 patients with 14 months pre-ert and 22 months ert median follow-up), ert affected muscle strength positively (manual muscle testing +3.3 pp/y, p < 0.001 and hand-held dynamometry +7.9 pp/y, p < 0.001). its effect on upright fvc was +1.8 pp/y (p = 0.08) and on supine fvc +0.8 (p = 0.38). favorable prognostic factors were female gender for muscle strength, and younger age and better clinical status for supine fvc. we conclude that ert positively alters the natural course of pompe disease in adult patients; muscle strength increased and upright fvc stabilized. functional outcome is probably best when ert intervention is timely.	-1
sensitivity of whole exome sequencing in detecting infantile- and late-onset pompe disease.  pompe disease is a metabolic myopathy with a wide spectrum of clinical presentation. the gold-standard diagnostic test is acid alpha-glucosidase assay on skin fibroblasts, muscle or blood. identification of two gaa pathogenic variants in-trans is confirmatory. optimal effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy hinges on early diagnosis, which is challenging in late-onset form of the disease due to non-specific presentation. next-generation sequencing-based panels effectively facilitate diagnosis, but the sensitivity of whole-exome sequencing (wes) in detecting pathogenic gaa variants remains unknown. we analyzed wes data from 93 patients with confirmed pompe disease and gaa genotypes based on pcr/sanger sequencing. after ensuring that the common intronic variant c.-32-13t>g is not filtered out, whole-exome sequencing identified both gaa pathogenic variants in 77/93 (83%) patients. however, one variant was missed in 14/93 (15%), and both variants were missed in 2/93 (2%). one complex indel leading to a severe phenotype was incorrectly called a nonsynonymous substitution c.-32-13t>c due to misalignment. these results demonstrate that wes may fail to diagnose pompe disease. clinicians need to be aware of limitations of wes, and consider tests specific to pompe disease when wes does not provide a diagnosis in patients with proximal myopathy, progressive respiratory failure or other subtle symptoms.	-1
fabry disease: polymorphic haplotypes and a novel missense mutation in the gla gene.  fabry disease: polymorphic haplotypes and a novel missense mutation in the gla gene. fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder with a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical manifestations that are caused by the deficiency of ?-galactosidase a (?-gal-a) activity. although useful for diagnosis in males, enzyme activity is not a reliable biochemical marker in heterozygous females due to random x-chromosome inactivation, thus rendering dna sequencing of the ?-gal-a gene, alpha-galactosidase gene (gla), the most reliable test for the confirmation of diagnosis in females. the spectrum of gla mutations is highly heterogeneous. many polymorphic gla variants have been described, but it is unclear if haplotypes formed by combinations of such variants correlate with fd, thus complicating molecular diagnosis in females with normal ?-gal-a activity. we tested 67 female probands with clinical manifestations that may be associated with fd and 110 control males with normal ?-gal-a activity. five different combinations of gla polymorphic variants were identified in 14 of the 67 females, whereas clearcut pathogenetic alterations, p.met51ile and p.met290leu, were identified in two cases. the latter has not been reported so far, and both mutant forms were found to be responsive to the pharmacological chaperone deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj; migalastat hydrochloride). analysis of the male control population, as well as male relatives of a suspected fd female proband, permitted the identification of seven different gla gene haplotypes in strong linkage disequilibrium. the identification of haplotypes in control males provides evidence against their involvement in the development of fd phenotypic manifestations.	-1
structural features of the regulatory act domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.  phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) catalyzes the conversion of l-phe to l-tyr. defects in pah activity, caused by mutations in the human gene, result in the autosomal recessively inherited disease hyperphenylalaninemia. pah activity is regulated by multiple factors, including phosphorylation and ligand binding. in particular, pah displays positive cooperativity for l-phe, which is proposed to bind the enzyme on an allosteric site in the n-terminal regulatory domain (rd), also classified as an act domain. this domain is found in several proteins and is able to bind amino acids. we used molecular dynamics simulations to obtain dynamical and structural insights into the isolated rd of pah. here we show that the principal motions involve conformational changes leading from an initial open to a final closed domain structure. the global intrinsic motions of the rd are correlated with exposure to solvent of a hydrophobic surface, which corresponds to the ligand binding-site of the act domain. our results strongly suggest a relationship between the phe-binding function and the overall dynamic behaviour of the enzyme. this relationship may be affected by structure-disturbing mutations. to elucidate the functional implications of the mutations, we investigated the structural effects on the dynamics of the human rd pah induced by six missense hyperphenylalaninemia-causing mutations, namely p.g46s, p.f39c, p.f39l, p.i65s, p.i65t and p.i65v. these studies showed that the alterations in rd hydrophobic interactions induced by missense mutations could affect the functionality of the whole enzyme.	1

correlation of spect imaging, biochemical parameters and mutation with systolic dysfunction.  we investigated systolic dysfunction by the use of biochemical laboratory tests and perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography imaging in 32 pakistani subjects exhibiting symptoms of this disorder. to investigate underlying genetic causes, such as familial hypercholesterolemia, dna samples from these subjects were screened by pcr-sscp and dna sequencing to detect changes in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene (ldlr). a novel mutation (1171g>a) in exon 8 and two polymorphisms (1167g>a and 1413 a>g) in exons 8 and 10 of the ldlr gene were found. in silico tools such as sift, polyphen-2, kd4v, and project hope were used to predict the effect of this mutation on protein structure and function.	-1
malignant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by the arg723gly mutation in beta-myosin heavy chain gene.  mutations causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have been described in nine genes encoding sarcomeric proteins. we report a new mutation in three families, with a c-->g transversion in nucleotide 12 307 of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene, located at the essential light chain interacting region, resulting in the replacement of arginine by glycine at amino acid residue 723. pcr amplification of the selected regions followed by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, dna sequencing of the polymorphic patterns and restriction analysis were used to detect the mutation. a total of 23 individuals were diagnosed as carriers, and seven were obligate carriers or had been clinically diagnosed. the arg723gly mutation was associated with a malignant phenotype. ten out of 30 affected members died suddenly or needed an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator at a mean age of 42, and seven members developed progressive heart failure, leading to death or heart transplant in five, at a mean age of 50 years. echocardiography showed non-obstructive left ventricular hypertrophy in affected members older than 20 (sensitivity 68%). mean survival of affected members was 51 years. in conclusion, a new mutation arg723gly in beta-myosin heavy chain gene is reported which shortens life expectancy because of sudden death and end-stage heart failure.	-1
measurement of urinary cdh and cth by tandem mass spectrometry in patients hemizygous and heterozygous for fabry disease.  fabry disease is an x-linked disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase a. this deficiency leads to the progressive accumulation, in lysosomes of visceral tissues and in body fluids of hemizygotes, of the glycosphingolipids globotriaosylceramide (cth, gb(3) or gl-3) and galabiosylceramide (cdh) and to a lesser extent the blood group ab and b related glycolipids. elevated levels of the glycosphingolipids are found in the urine of hemizygous males with the classic phenotype, but it is not known whether all symptomatic or asymptomatic heterozygotes have elevated levels. we have therefore measured cth and cdh quantitatively in a multiplex assay using tandem mass spectrometry in urine from a large cohort (44) of genetically proven or obligate heterozygotes including four with the n215s mutation, from classic hemizygotes (28), from cardiac variant hemizygotes with the n215s mutation (6) and from normal controls. the levels of cth and cdh were related to both creatinine and sphingomyelin. urinary cth was elevated in all 28 classic hemizygotes but only in 4/6 of the cardiac variants. the level was within or just above the normal reference range in the four individuals heterozygous for the n215s mutation but was elevated in 38/40 of the other heterozygotes. similar results were obtained for cdh, except that only 34/40 heterozygotes had an elevated level. the level of cdh was not elevated in the four heterozygotes and 4/6 of the hemizygotes for the n215s mutation. combining the levels of cth and cdh did not improve the discrimination of heterozygotes from controls. the ratio of cdh to cth was higher in heterozygotes than in hemizygotes. measurement of urinary cth gave the best discrimination of heterozygotes from controls.	1
mutation analysis of the genes involved in the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway in korean patients with noonan syndrome.  noonan syndrome (ns) is a congenital abnormality that affects multiple parts of the body. approximately 50% of cases are caused by mutations in the ptpn11 gene. ns shares many clinical features with a group of developmental disorders including costello syndrome and cardio-facio-cutaneous (cfc) syndrome. recently, kras and sos1 were identified as causative genes for ns. moreover, mutations in several genes associated with the ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway, including hras, braf, mek1, and mek2 were identified in patients with costello syndrome and cfc syndrome. accordingly, this study carried out mutation analysis of nine genes including ptpn11, sos1, grb2, kras, hras, nras, braf, mek1, and mek2 associated with the ras-mapk pathway in 14 korean patients with ns. seven patients were found to have mutations in the ptpn11 gene. mutation analyses of the other genes did not reveal any disease causing mutations except for one unclassified variation in the 3'-untranslated region of the hras gene (c.*1c>t). the patient's father also had the same substitution with the normal phenotype. therefore, this variation is believed to be either a rare polymorphism or a disease-related variation with variable penetrance. the ras-mapk pathway has now emerged as a key cascade in a group of similar developmental disorders as well as in many types of cancers. this study found that, with the exception of ptpn11, mutations in genes related to the ras-mapk pathway appear to be uncommon, at least in korean patients with ns.	-1
the importance of an integrated analysis of clinical, molecular, and functional data for the genetic diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is one of the most common monogenic disorders, and the high concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol presented since birth confers on these patients an increased cardiovascular risk. more than 1,600 alterations have been described in the ldl receptor gene (ldlr), but a large number need to be validated as mutations causing disease to establish a diagnosis of fh. this study aims to characterize, both at the phenotypic and genotypic levels, families with a clinical diagnosis of fh and present evidence for the importance of the integration of clinical, molecular, and functional data for the correct diagnosis of patients with fh. a detailed analysis of the phenotype and genotype presented by 55 families with 13 different alterations in the ldlr was conducted. for eight of these, an extensive functional characterization was performed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. carriers of neutral alterations presented a significantly lower incidence of premature cardiovascular disease, lower levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and a large number of these individuals had ldl-cholesterol values below the 75(th) percentile. presented a significantly lower incidence of premature cardiovascular disease, lower levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and a large number of these individuals had ldl-cholesterol values below the 75th percentile however, the functional study was essential to determine the pathogenicity of variants. the data collected illustrate the importance of this integrated analysis for the correct assessment of patients with fh who can otherwise be misdiagnosed.	1
unexpectedly low mutation rates in beta-myosin heavy chain and cardiac myosin binding protein genes in italian patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is the most common genetic cardiac disease. fourteen sarcomeric and sarcomere-related genes have been implicated in hcm etiology, those encoding ?-myosin heavy chain (myh7) and cardiac myosin binding protein c (mybpc3) reported as the most frequently mutated: in fact, these account for around 50% of all cases related to sarcomeric gene mutations, which are collectively responsible for approximately 70% of all hcm cases. here, we used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography followed by bidirectional sequencing to screen the coding regions of myh7 and mybpc3 in a cohort (n = 125) of italian patients presenting with hcm. we found 6 mhy7 mutations in 9/125 patients and 18 mybpc3 mutations in 19/125 patients. of the three novel myh7 mutations found, two were missense, and one was a silent mutation; of the eight novel mybpc3 mutations, one was a substitution, three were stop codons, and four were missense mutations. thus, our cohort of italian hcm patients did not harbor the high frequency of mutations usually found in myh7 and mybpc3. this finding, coupled to the clinical diversity of our cohort, emphasizes the complexity of hcm and the need for more inclusive investigative approaches in order to fully understand the pathogenesis of this disease.	-1
cochlin immunostaining of inner ear pathologic deposits and proteomic analysis in dfna9 deafness and vestibular dysfunction.  seven missense mutations and one in-frame deletion mutation have been reported in the coagulation factor c homology (coch) gene, causing the adult-onset, progressive sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular disorder at the dfna9 locus. prevalence of coch mutations worldwide is unknown, as there is no systematic screening effort for late-onset hearing disorders; however, to date, coch mutations have been found on four continents and the possibility of coch playing an important role in presbycusis and disorders of imbalance has been considered. cochlin (encoded by coch) has also been shown as a major target antigen for autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss. in this report, we present histopathology, immunohistochemistry and proteomic analyses of inner ear tissues from post-mortem dfna9 temporal bone samples of an individual from a large dutch kindred segregating the p51s mutation and adult human unaffected controls, and wild-type (+/+) and coch null (-/-) knock-out mice. dfna9 is an inner ear disorder with a unique histopathology showing loss of cellularity and aggregation of abundant homogeneous acellular eosinophilic deposits in the cochlear and vestibular labyrinths, similar to protein aggregation in well-known neurodegenerative disorders. by immunohistochemistry on the dfna9 temporal bone sections, we have shown cochlin staining of the characteristic cochlear and vestibular deposits, indicating aggregation of cochlin in the same structures in which it is normally expressed. proteomic analysis identified cochlin as the most abundant protein in mouse and human cochleae. the high-level expression and stability of cochlin in the inner ear, even in the absence and severe atrophy of the fibrocytes that normally express coch, are shown through these studies and further elucidate the pathobiologic events occurring in dfna9 leading to hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction.	1
mutations in lpl, apoc2, apoa5, gpihbp1 and lmf1 in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia.  the severe forms of hypertriglyceridaemia (htg) are caused by mutations in genes that lead to the loss of function of lipoprotein lipase (lpl). in most patients with severe htg (tg > 10 mmol l(-1) ), it is a challenge to define the underlying cause. we investigated the molecular basis of severe htg in patients referred to the lipid clinic at the academic medical center amsterdam. the coding regions of lpl, apoc2, apoa5 and two novel genes, lipase maturation factor 1 (lmf1) and gpi-anchored high-density lipoprotein (hdl)-binding protein 1 (gpihbp1), were sequenced in 86 patients with type 1 and type 5 htg and 327 controls. in 46 patients (54%), rare dna sequence variants were identified, comprising variants in lpl (n = 19), apoc2 (n = 1), apoa5 (n = 2), gpihbp1 (n = 3) and lmf1 (n = 8). in 22 patients (26%), only common variants in lpl (p.asp36asn, p.asn318ser and p.ser474ter) and apoa5 (p.ser19trp) could be identified, whereas no mutations were found in 18 patients (21%). in vitro validation revealed that the mutations in lmf1 were not associated with compromised lpl function. consistent with this, five of the eight lmf1 variants were also found in controls and therefore cannot account for the observed phenotype. the prevalence of mutations in lpl was 34% and mostly restricted to patients with type 1 htg. mutations in gpihbp1 (n = 3), apoc2 (n = 1) and apoa5 (n = 2) were rare but the associated clinical phenotype was severe. routine sequencing of candidate genes in severe htg has improved our understanding of the molecular basis of this phenotype associated with acute pancreatitis and may help to guide future individualized therapeutic strategies.	-1
the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolaemia in turkish patients.  familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disorder of lipoprotein metabolism. in the majority of patients fh is caused by mutations in the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), and to date more than 700 mutations have been reported worldwide. in this study, 36 paediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of fh (20 homozygous and 16 heterozygotes) were screened for mutations in the ldlr gene. each exon, with intron-exon junctions, was screened by capillary fluorescent sscp (f-sscp) and heteroduplex analysis. samples showing different band patterns were sequenced. ten novel (including three frame shift small deletions or insertions) and seven known mutations were detected. a total of 37 out of the predicted 56 fh-causing alleles were identified (66.1%). no patients with the r3500q mutation in the apob gene were found. w556r was the most common mutation, explaining 21.4% of the predicted defective ldlr alleles. the novel sequence changes were deemed to be pathogenic if they altered a conserved amino acid (l143p, d147e, q233h-c234g, c347g) or occurred in or close to a splice site (ivs 16+5) and were absent in dna from 50 healthy turkish subjects. these data confirm the genetic heterogeneity of fh in turkey, and demonstrate the usefulness of f-sscp for mutation detection.	-1
the contribution of gjb2 mutations to slight or mild hearing loss in australian elementary school children.  there is a lack of information on prevalence, cause and consequences of slight/mild bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) in children. we report the first systematic genetic analysis of the gjb2 gene in a population-derived sample of children with slight/mild bilateral snhl. hearing tests were conducted in 6240 australian elementary school children in grades 1 and 5. 55 children (0.88%) were found to have a slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss. 48 children with slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss and a matched group of 90 children with normal hearing participated in a genetic study investigating mutations in the gjb2 gene, coding for connexin 26, and the presence of the del(gjb6-d13s1830) and del(gjb6-d13s1854) deletions in the gjb6 gene, coding for connexin 30. four of 48 children with slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss were homozygous for the gjb2 v37i change. the four children with homozygous v37i mutations were all of asian background and analysis of snps in or near the gjb2 gene suggests that the v37i mutation arose from a single mutational event in the asian population. based on the prevalence of carriers of this change we conclude that v37i can be a causative mutation that is often associated with slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss. no other children in the slight/mild hearing loss group had a hearing loss related to a gjb2 mutation. one child with normal hearing was homozygous for the r127h change and we conclude that this change does not cause hearing loss. two children of asian background were carriers of the v37i mutation. our data indicate that slight/mild sensorineural hearing loss due to the gjb2 v37i mutation is common in people of asian background.	-1
a novel mutation thr162arg of the melanocortin 4 receptor gene in a spanish children and adolescent population.  the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (mc4r) is involved in body weight regulation. while many studies associated mc4r mutations with childhood obesity, information on mc4r mutations in spanish children and adolescents is lacking. our objective was to screen a population of children and adolescents from the north of spain (navarra) for mc4r mutations and to study the phenotypes of carriers and their families. in addition, functional assays were performed for a novel mc4r mutation. the study was composed of 451 spanish children and adolescents (49% boys), aged 5-18 year. according to the international obesity task force (iotf) criteria, the groups included 160 obese, 132 overweight and 159 normal-weight control subjects. one novel (thr162arg) and three known nonsynonymous mutations in the mc4r gene (ser30phe, thr150ile, ala244glu) were detected heterozygously. the mc4r mutations were found in three male (one obese and two overweight) and two female subjects (one obese and one overweight). the novel mutation did not appear to lead to an impaired receptor function. an unequivocal relationship of mc4r mutations with obesity in pedigrees together with an impaired function of the encoded receptor could not be established for any of the mutations. the presence of heterozygous mc4r mutations in obese and overweight subjects indicates that these mutations may be a susceptibility factor for obesity development, but lifestyle factors, such as exercise or sedentary activities, may modify their effect.	-1
high frequency of pten mutations in nevi and melanomas from xeroderma pigmentosum patients.  we examined nevi and melanomas in 10 xeroderma pigmentosum (xp) patients with defective dna repair. the lesions had a lentiginous appearance with markedly increased numbers of melanocytes. using laser capture microdissection, we performed dna sequencing of 18 benign and atypical nevi and 75 melanomas (melanoma in situ and invasive melanomas). the nevi had a similar high frequency of pten mutations as melanomas [61% (11/18) versus 53% (39/73)]. both had a very high proportion of uv-type mutations (occurring at adjacent pyrimidines) [91% (10/11) versus 92% (36/39)]. in contrast to melanomas in the general population, the frequency of braf mutations (11%, 7/61), nras mutations (21%, 13/62), and kit mutations (21%, 6/28) in xp melanomas was lower than for pten. phospho-s6 immunostaining indicated activation of the mtor pathway in the atypical nevi and melanomas. thus, the clinical and histological appearances and the molecular pathology of these uv-related xp nevi and melanomas were different from nevi and melanomas in the general population.	-1
next generation sequencing based identification of disease-associated mutations in swiss patients with retinal dystrophies.  inherited monogenic diseases of the retina and vitreous affect approximately 1 in 2000 individuals. they are characterized by tremendous genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability involving mutations in approximately 250 genes and more than 20 different clinical phenotypes. clinical manifestations of retinal dystrophies (rds) range from mild retinal dysfunctions to severe congenital forms of blindness. a detailed clinical diagnosis and the identification of causative mutations are crucial for genetic counseling of affected patients and their families, for understanding genotype-phenotype correlations and developing therapeutic approaches. using whole exome sequencing (wes) we have established a reliable and efficient high-throughput analysis pipeline to identify disease-causing mutations. our data indicate that this approach enables us to genetically diagnose approximately 64% of the patients (n = 58) with variant(s) in known disease-associated genes. we report 20 novel and 26 recurrent variants in genes associated with rds. we also identified a novel phenotype for mutations in c2orf71 and provide functional evidence for exon skipping due to a splice-site variant identified in flvcr1. in conclusion, wes can rapidly identify variants in various families affected with different forms of rds. our study also expands the clinical and allelic spectrum of genes associated with rds in the swiss population.	-1
molecular characterization of phenylketonuria and tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in japan.  phenylketonuria (pku) is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). on the basis of phenotype/genotype correlations, determination of phenylketonuric genotype is important for classification of the clinical phenotype and treatment of pku, including tetrahydrobiopterin therapy. we characterized the genotypes of 203 japanese patients with pku and hyperphenylalaninemia using the following systems: (1) denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography with a gc-clamped primer; (2) direct sequencing; and, (3) multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. of 406 mutant alleles, 390 (96%) were genotyped; 65 mutations were identified, including 22 new mutations. r413p, r241c, ivs4-1g>a, r111x and r243q were prevalent mutations. mutations prevalent in the japanese cohort are also common in korean and northern chinese populations, suggesting same origin. the spectrum of prevalent mutations was not significantly different among six japanese districts, indicating that japan comprises a relatively homogeneous ethnic group. we classified the mutations by clinical phenotypes and in vivo pah activity and estimated the mutations with potential tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) responsiveness. the frequency of bh(4) responsiveness based on the genotype was 29.1% in japanese pku patients. a catalog of pku genotypes would be useful for predicting clinical phenotype, deciding on the subsequent treatment of pku including bh(4) therapy, and genetic counseling in east asia.	-1
a nonsense mutation in the acid ?-glucosidase gene causes pompe disease in finnish and swedish lapphunds.  pompe disease is a recessively inherited and often fatal disorder caused by the deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase, an enzyme encoded by the gaa gene and needed to break down glycogen in lysosomes. this glycogen storage disease type ii has been reported also in swedish lapphund dogs. here we describe the genetic defect in canine pompe disease and show that three related breeds from scandinavia carry the same mutation. the affected dogs are homozygous for the gaa c.2237g>a mutation leading to a premature stop codon at amino acid position 746. the corresponding mutation has previously been reported in humans and causes infantile pompe disease in combination with a second fully deleterious mutation. the affected dogs from both the finnish as well as the swedish breed mimic infantile-onset pompe disease genetically, but also clinico-pathologically. therefore this canine model provides a valuable tool for preclinical studies aimed at the development of gene therapy in pompe disease.	1
relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance in females with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report from the maternal phenylketonuria collaborative study.  to examine the relationship of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) genotypes to biochemical phenotype and cognitive development in maternal phenylketonuria (pku). pah gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the maternal pku collaborative study (mpkucs). a total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe pku, moderate pku, mild pku, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [mhp]). then, 189 mpkucs subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. the sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. these patients are considered functionally hemizygous. the biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. cognitive performance (iq) was also significantly related to genotype. the iq of pah-deficient mothers with a severe pku mutation in combination with a mhp mutation or a mild pku mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the iq of pku mothers with two severe pku mutations or with one severe and one moderate pku mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. of the patients with pku, 92% had been treated during childhood. those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average iq scores for their group of mutation combinations. females with moderate or mild pku who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed iq scores 10 points above average for their group. the reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with pku. the significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with pku who plan pregnancy.	-1
exome sequencing of case-unaffected-parents trios reveals recessive and de novo genetic variants in sporadic als.  the contribution of genetic variants to sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) remains largely unknown. either recessive or de novo variants could result in an apparently sporadic occurrence of als. in an attempt to find such variants we sequenced the exomes of 44 als-unaffected-parents trios. rare and potentially damaging compound heterozygous variants were found in 27% of als patients, homozygous recessive variants in 14% and coding de novo variants in 27%. in 20% of patients more than one of the above variants was present. genes with recessive variants were enriched in nucleotide binding capacity, atpase activity, and the dynein heavy chain. genes with de novo variants were enriched in transcription regulation and cell cycle processes. this trio study indicates that rare private recessive variants could be a mechanism underlying some case of sporadic als, and that de novo mutations are also likely to play a part in the disease.	-1
the intracellular e-cadherin germline mutation v832 m lacks the ability to mediate cell-cell adhesion and to suppress invasion.  e-cadherin germline missense mutations have been shown to be responsible for significant loss of protein activity. a new cytoplasmic e-cadherin germline missense mutation (v832 m) was recently identified in a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) japanese family. this e-cadherin mutant was cloned in a chinese hamster ovary cell model system and functionally characterized, in terms of aggregation and invasion. cells expressing the germline v832m mutant fail to aggregate and invade into collagen, supporting the pathogenic role of this germline missense mutation in gastric cancer. we also tested the ability of this mutation to activate the tcf-lef trascriptional activity, in comparison with three other e-cadherin missense mutations (t340a, a634v and a617t), associated to loss of e-cadherin function. all the e-cadherin mutants reduced tcf-lef activation to a similar extent as the wild-type protein, suggesting that the oncogenic effect of the e-cadherin mutants is unlikely to be transmitted through a beta-catenin-dependent activation of the wnt pathway.	1
"variations in genotype-phenotype correlations in phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in chinese han population.  the value of genotyping to predict variant phenotypes in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency is a matter of debate. however, there exists no comprehensive population relationship study focused on the han chinese. we analyzed genotype-phenotype correlation for 186 different genotypes in 338 unrelated chinese patients harboring 109 different pah mutations. two systems were used in this process. the first was a phenotype prediction system based on arbitrary values (av) attributed to each mutation. the second was a pair-wise correlation analysis. the observed phenotype for av analysis was the corresponding metabolic phenotype stratified according to the pretreatment phenylalanine (phe) value. we found that the observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 54.41% of 272 patients for whom av information was available; the highest degree of concordance (61.83%) was found in patients with null/null genotypes, whereas the lowest ""concordance rate"" (32.69%) was observed for patients with expected mild-pku phenotype. there are repeated inconsistencies for such mutations as r241c, r243q, r261q, v388m, v399v, r408q, a434d and ex6-96a>g which are associated with variable phenotypes in patients with identical genotype. significant correlations were disclosed between pretreatment phe values and predicted residual activity (r=-0.45643, p<0.0001) or av sum (r=-0.59523, p<0.0001). our study supports the notion that the pah mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients in a particular population, and provided novel insights into the values that underpin the subsequent treatment and the prognosis of pku in chinese."	-1
late onset variants in fabry disease: results in high risk population screenings in argentina.  screening for fabry disease (fd) in high risk populations yields a significant number of individuals with novel, ultra rare genetic variants in the gla gene, largely without classic manifestations of fd. these variants often have significant residual ?-galactosidase a activity. the establishment of the pathogenic character of previously unknown or rare variants is challenging but necessary to guide therapeutic decisions. to present 2 cases of non-classical presentations of fd with renal involvement as well as to discuss the importance of high risk population screenings for fd. our patients with non-classical variants were diagnosed through fd screenings in dialysis units. however, organ damage was not limited to kidneys, since lvh, vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia and cornea verticillata were also present. lyso-gb3 concentrations in plasma were in the pathologic range, compatible with late onset fd. structural studies and in silico analysis of p.(cys174gly) and p.(arg363his), employing different tools, suggest that enzyme destabilization and possibly aggregation could play a role in organ damage. screening programs for fd in high risk populations are important as fd is a treatable multisystemic disease which is frequently overlooked in patients who present without classical manifestations.	-1
integrated analysis of germline and somatic variants in ovarian cancer.  we report the first large-scale exome-wide analysis of the combined germline-somatic landscape in ovarian cancer. here we analyse germline and somatic alterations in 429 ovarian carcinoma cases and 557 controls. we identify 3,635 high confidence, rare truncation and 22,953 missense variants with predicted functional impact. we find germline truncation variants and large deletions across fanconi pathway genes in 20% of cases. enrichment of rare truncations is shown in brca1, brca2 and palb2. in addition, we observe germline truncation variants in genes not previously associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility (nf1, map3k4, cdkn2b and mll3). evidence for loss of heterozygosity was found in 100 and 76% of cases with germline brca1 and brca2 truncations, respectively. germline-somatic interaction analysis combined with extensive bioinformatics annotation identifies 222 candidate functional germline truncation and missense variants, including two pathogenic brca1 and 1 tp53 deleterious variants. finally, integrated analyses of germline and somatic variants identify significantly altered pathways, including the fanconi, mapk and mll pathways.	-1
chaperone-like therapy with tetrahydrobiopterin in clinical trials for phenylketonuria: is genotype a predictor of response?  prospectively enrolled phenylketonuria patients (n=485) participated in an international phase ii clinical trial to identify the prevalence of a therapeutic response to daily doses of sapropterin dihydrochloride (sapropterin, kuvan()). responsive patients were then enrolled in two subsequent phase iii clinical trials to examine safety, ability to reduce blood phenylalanine levels, dosage (5-20 mg/kg/day) and response, and bioavailability of sapropterin. we combined phenotypic findings in the phase ii and iii clinical trials to classify study-related responsiveness associated with specific alleles and genotypes identified in the patients. we found that 17% of patients showed a response to sapropterin. the patients harbored 245 different genotypes derived from 122 different alleles, among which ten alleles were newly discovered. only 16.3% of the genotypes clearly conferred a sapropterin-responsive phenotype. among the different pah alleles, only 5% conferred a responsive phenotype. the responsive alleles were largely but not solely missense mutations known to or likely to cause misfolding of the pah subunit. however, the metabolic response was not robustly predictable from the pah genotypes, based on the study design adopted for these clinical trials, and accordingly it seems prudent to test each person for this phenotype with a standardized protocol.	-1
quality of diagnostic mutation analyses for phenylketonuria.  dna sequence analyses have become a major component in the diagnostic work-up of patients; however, limited consideration appears to be given to the possibility that reported results may in fact be wrong. over the last four years we have carried out an external quality assessment scheme for mutation analysis in phenylketonuria. each year, three dna samples with previously characterized genotypes were mailed to participating laboratories. indications for testing were either confirmation of diagnosis and prediction of disease severity, or carrier analysis. each year there were several laboratories that failed to identify mutations because of methodological limitations. of the participating laboratories that used comprehensive mutation detection methods, each year there was at least one that missed at least one mutation. indeed, in the 2007 scheme almost 8% of reports from laboratories that used comprehensive mutation detection methods such as sequencing of all exons of the pah gene contained incorrect genotypes. there were also serious deficiencies in the interpretation of genotype data: in the 2007 scheme, 6 out of 10 laboratories that obtained full genotyping marks for interpretation incurred a reduction of marks because information on the expected phenotype was missing or wrong. several laboratories failed to appreciate the clinical relevance of a mutation associated with mild hyperphenylalaninaemia, which does not require treatment, and some discussed the option of prenatal diagnosis in the respective case. in conclusion, mutation analyses may be prone to errors and this demands careful interpretation of results in relation to clinical and biochemical findings.	-1
tailor-made protein tyrosine phosphatases: in vitro site-directed mutagenesis of pten and ptprz-b.  in vitro site-directed mutagenesis (sdm) of protein tyrosine phosphatases (ptps) is a commonly used approach to experimentally analyze ptp functions at the molecular and cellular level and to establish functional correlations with ptp alterations found in human disease. here, using the tumor-suppressor pten and the receptor-type ptprz-b (short isoform from ptprz1 gene) phosphatases as examples, we provide a brief insight into the utility of specific mutations in the experimental analysis of ptp functions. we describe a standardized, rapid, and simple method of mutagenesis to perform single and multiple amino acid substitutions, as well as deletions of short nucleotide sequences, based on one-step inverse pcr and dpni restriction enzyme treatment. this method of sdm is generally applicable to any other protein of interest.	1
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: a family diagnosis and treatment.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is a rare cancer representing approximately 2% of all gastric cancers. it is caused by cdhi gene mutations, inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, that affect the function of e-cadherin. approximately 38% of hdgc families have a cdhi gene mutation. with an estimated 75% penetrance rate, carriers are at high risk for hdgc. we describe the case of a caucasian male of german-russian ancestry, carrying a cdhi gene mutation, who survived for 18 months after being diagnosed with hdgc. the results of genetic testing undergone by his family members are also reported, along with a review of the current literature. since surveillance methods for hdgc are ineffective and unreliable, total prophylactic gastrectomy is advised for individuals with the gene mutation. additionally, a diagnosis of hdgc should lead to genetic evaluation of family members followed by preventative measures.	-1
familial gastric cancer - aetiology and pathogenesis.  gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death worldwide. it is estimated that 5-10% of gastric cancer cases have a familial association; however, knowledge concerning the genetic predisposition to familial gastric cancer is currently limited. in this chapter we discuss what is known about the aetiology and pathogenesis of both the diffuse and intestinal forms of familial gastric cancer. we focus particularly on hereditary diffuse gastric cancer because the discovery of germ-line e-cadherin mutations in a number of affected families has opened the prospect of identifying gene carriers, with implications for clinical management. the interplay of other conventional risk factors, such as helicobacter pylori infection, with genetic factors is also discussed. it is hoped that understanding the genetic basis for familial gastric cancer will facilitate the development of clinically useful screening and preventative procedures.	-1
sixty six-month follow-up of muscle power and respiratory function in a case with adult-type pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy.  we report a patient with adult-type pompe disease treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ert) for 5.5 years. we evaluated pulmonary function and muscle strength using 6-minute walk test, manual muscle test, and dynamometer-based measurement. the long-term ert resulted in a substantial improvement in the pulmonary function and a possible stabilization followed by mild deterioration in muscle power measured by dynamometer and 6-minute walk test. our data may rationalize the long-term use of ert for adult-type pompe disease in terms of maintaining pulmonary function.	-1
a novel her2-positive breast cancer phenotype arising from germline tp53 mutations.  the li-fraumeni syndrome is caused by a germline tp53 mutation and is associated with a high risk of breast cancer at young ages. basal (triple negative) breast cancers are now well recognised to be a typical sub-type of breast cancer developing in a large proportion of brca1 gene carriers. we considered whether a similar narrow sub-type of breast cancer was found in tp53 gene mutation carriers. a hypothesis generating study to investigate whether there are specific breast tumour characteristics associated with germline tp53 mutations. pathological characteristics in 12 breast cancers arising in nine patients carrying pathogenic tp53 mutations were compared to a reference panel of 231 young onset breast tumours included in the posh study. patients carrying a tp53 mutation showed a significantly higher likelihood of developing a breast cancer with human epidermal growth factor receptor (her2) amplification (83%) when compared to the cohort of young onset breast cancer cases (16%); er and pr status were equivalent between groups. these findings suggest that breast cancer developing on a background of an inherited tp53 mutation is highly likely to present with amplification of her2.	-1
a new insight into structural and functional impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pten gene.  phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) plays essential roles in cellular processes including survival, proliferation, energy metabolism, and cellular architecture. activating the mutations of pten has long been known to produce a variety of disorders, mainly diabetes and cancer in humans. owing to the importance of pten gene, a functional analysis using different in silico approaches was undertaken to explore the possible associations between genetic mutations and phenotypic variation. sift, polyphen, i-mutant 3.0, snp&go, and phd-snp were used for initial screening of functional nssnps. from the observed results, three mutations r47g, h61d, and v343e were selected based on their surface accessibility and total energy change. by molecular dynamics approach, h61d showed increase in flexibility, radius of gyration, solvent accessibility, and deviated more from the native structure which was supported by the decrease in the number of hydrogen bonds. further from principal component analysis and interaction analysis, we identified significant structural changes that can reasonably explain the involvement of deviations in stability caused by mutations. our analysis also predicts the involvement of snps that could potentially influence post-translational modifications in pten gene. these in silico predictions could provide a new insight into structural and functional impact of pten polymorphisms.	-1
[malignant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by the arg723gly mutation in beta-myosin heavy chain gene in a chinese pedigree].  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease and an arg723gly mutation in beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-mhc) gene was found in 3 spanish families with malignant hcm. we detected this gene mutation in 5 chinese pedigrees with hypertensive cardiomyopathy. five chinese pedigrees with hcm and 80 age-matched normal control subjects were chosen for the study. the exons in the functional regions of the beta-mhc gene were amplified with pcr and the products were sequenced, genotype and phenotype analyzed. arg723gly mutation was identified in exon 20 in one pedigree. in this pedigree, 13 out of 25 family members were diagnosed as hcm, 5 died of heart failure, all hcm patients in this pedigree had arg723gly mutation and 3 of them had nyha iii and 2 of them were diagnosed as hcm before the age of 20. arg723gly mutation was also one of the main disease-causing genes in chinese familial hcm. the mutation of arg723gly is a malignant phenotype as shown by early progressive heart failure development and poor prognosis in this pedigree with arg723gly mutation.	-1
molecular and in silico analyses of the full-length isoform of usherin identify new pathogenic alleles in usher type ii patients.  the usherin gene (ush2a) has been screened for mutations causing usher syndrome type ii (ush2). two protein isoforms have been identified: a short isoform of 1,546 amino acids and a more recently recognized isoform extending to 5,202 amino acids. we have screened the full length by genomic sequencing. we confirm that many mutations occur in the exons contributing solely to the longer form. ush2 is an autosomal recessive disorder and, in contrast to previous studies, both mutations were identified in 23 patients and a single mutation in 2 out of 33 patients. a total of 34 distinct mutated alleles were identified, including one complex allele with three variants and another with two. a total of 27 of these are novel, confirming that most mutations in usherin are private. many of the mutations will lead to prematurely truncated protein but as there are a substantial number of missense variants, we have used in silico analysis to assess their pathogenicity. evidence that they are disease-causing has been produced by protein alignments and three-dimensional (3d) structural predictions when possible. we have identified a previously unrecognized cysteine rich structural domain, containing 12 dicysteine repeats, and show that three missense mutations result in the loss of one of a pair of the defining cysteine-cysteine pairs.	-1
brca1, tp53, and chek2 germline mutations in uterine serous carcinoma.  uterine serous carcinoma (usc) is not recognized as part of any defined hereditary cancer syndrome, and its association with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma and lynch syndrome are uncertain. using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, 151 subjects with usc were assessed for germline mutations in 30 tumor suppressor genes, including brca1 (breast cancer 1, early onset), brca2, the dna mismatch repair genes (mlh1 [mutl homolog 1], msh2 [muts homolog 2], msh6, pms2 [postmeiotic segregation increased 2]), tp53 (tumor protein p53), and 10 other genes in the fanconi anemia-brca pathway. ten cases with < 10% serous histology were also assessed. seven subjects (4.6%) carried germline loss-of-function mutations: 3 subjects (2.0%) with mutations in brca1, 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in tp53, and 2 subjects (1.3%) with mutations in chek2 (checkpoint kinase 2). one subject with < 10% serous histology had an msh6 mutation. subjects with msh6 and tp53 mutations had neither personal nor family histories suggestive of lynch or li-fraumeni syndromes. of the 22 women with usc and a personal history of breast carcinoma, the frequency of brca1 mutations was 9%, compared to 0.9% in 119 women with no such history. approximately 5% of women with usc have germline mutations in 3 different tumor suppressor genes: brca1, chek2, and tp53. mutations in dna mismatch repair genes that cause lynch syndrome are rare in usc. the germline brca1 mutation rate in usc subjects of 2% is higher than expected in a nonfounder population, suggesting that usc is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma in a small proportion of cases. women with usc and breast cancer should be offered genetic testing for brca1 and brca2 mutations.	-1
atrio-ventricular block requiring pacemaker in patients with late onset pompe disease.  enzyme replacement therapy consistently improves cardiac function in infantile and juvenile onset patients with pompe disease and cardiomyopathy, but is apparently not effective in preventing rhythm disorders, an emerging cardiac phenotype in long term survivors. in patients with late onset pompe disease cardiomyopathy is an exceptional finding while heart rhythm disorders seem to be more frequent. we retrospectively identified, among a cohort of 131 french late onset pompe disease patients, four patients with severe atrio-ventricular blocks requiring pacemaker implantation. these patients had no other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases or cardiomyopathy. in one patient the atrioventricular block was discovered while still asymptomatic. cardiac conduction defects are relatively rare in late onset pompe disease and may occur even in absence of cardiac symptoms or ekg abnormalities. however because of the possible life-threatening complications associated with these conduction defects, cardiac follow-up in patients with late onset pompe disease should include periodical holter-ekg monitoring.	-1
role of protein misfolding in dfna9 hearing loss.  mutations in the coch (coagulation factor c homology) gene have been attributed to dfna9 (deafness, autosomal-dominant 9), an autosomal-dominant non-syndromic hearing loss disorder. however, the mechanisms responsible for dfna9 hearing loss remain unknown. here, we demonstrate that mutant cochlin, the protein product of the coch gene, forms a stable dimer that is sensitive to reducing agent. in contrast, wild-type (wt) cochlin may form only dimers transiently. interestingly, the presence of mutant cochlin can stabilize wt cochlin in dimer conformation, providing a possible mechanism for the dominant nature of dfna9 mutations. furthermore, the expression of mutant cochlin eventually induces wt cochlin to form stable oligomers that are resistant to reducing agent. finally, we show that mutant cochlin is cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo. our study suggests a possible molecular mechanism underlying dfna9 hearing loss and provides an in vitro model that may be used to explore protein-misfolding diseases in general.	1
mutations in myh7 reduce the force generating capacity of sarcomeres in human familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), frequently caused by sarcomeric gene mutations, is characterized by cellular dysfunction and asymmetric left-ventricular (lv) hypertrophy. we studied whether cellular dysfunction is due to an intrinsic sarcomere defect or cardiomyocyte remodelling. cardiac samples from 43 sarcomere mutation-positive patients (hcmmut: mutations in thick (mybpc3, myh7) and thin (tpm1, tnni3, tnnt2) myofilament genes) were compared with 14 sarcomere mutation-negative patients (hcmsmn), eight patients with secondary lv hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis (lvhao) and 13 donors. force measurements in single membrane-permeabilized cardiomyocytes revealed significantly lower maximal force generating capacity (fmax) in hcmmut (21  1 kn/m) and hcmsmn (26  3 kn/m) compared with donor (36  2 kn/m). cardiomyocyte remodelling was more severe in hcmmut compared with hcmsmn based on significantly lower myofibril density (49  2 vs. 63  5%) and significantly higher cardiomyocyte area (915  15 vs. 612  11 ?m). low fmax in mybpc3mut, tnni3mut, hcmsmn, and lvhao was normalized to donor values after correction for myofibril density. however, fmax was significantly lower in myh7mut, tpm1mut, and tnnt2mut even after correction for myofibril density. in accordance, measurements in single myofibrils showed very low fmax in myh7mut, tpm1mut, and tnnt2mut compared with donor (respectively, 73  3, 70  7, 83  6, and 113  5 kn/m). in addition, force was lower in myh7mut cardiomyocytes compared with mybpc3mut, hcmsmn, and donor at submaximal [ca?]. low cardiomyocyte fmax in hcm patients is largely explained by hypertrophy and reduced myofibril density. myh7 mutations reduce force generating capacity of sarcomeres at maximal and submaximal [ca?]. these hypocontractile sarcomeres may represent the primary abnormality in patients with myh7 mutations.	-1
detection of mutations in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in taiwan.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a common genetic cardiac disorder associated with sudden death, heart failure, and stroke. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence and types of mutations in symptomatic patients with hcm in taiwan. thirty-eight hcm index patients (mean age 6016 years) underwent systematic mutation screening of eight sarcomeric genes: ?-myosin heavy chain (myh7), myosin-binding protein c (mybpc3), troponin t (tnnt2), troponin i (tnni3), myosin ventricular regulatory light chain 2 (myl2), myosin ventricular essential light chain 1 (myl3), ?-tropomyosin (tpm1), and cardiac ?-actin (actc), using direct dna sequencing. in silico programs predicted damaging amino acids. in the positive families, genotype-phenotype correlation studies were done. overall, 13 mutations were identified in 13 index patients (34.2%). the three most frequently mutated genes were myh7, mybpc3, and tnnt2. one patient carried double mutations. five mutations (myh7 r147s; mybpc3 r597q; mybpc3 w1007r; tnni3 e124q; myl3 r63c) were novel; all were missense mutations. analysis using in silico tools showed near consensus to classify these five novel mutations as pathological. family pedigree analysis showed the presence of cosegregation in at least two affected members in each proband family, but incomplete penetrance in young family members with a positive genotype. we identified 13 hcm pedigrees, including 5 carrying novel mutations and 1 with a double mutation. the three most commonly mutated genes were myh7, mybpc3, and tnnt2. these results, together with genetic counseling, could lead to earlier diagnosis and better management of family members at risk of hcm.	-1
comparative study of endoscopic surveillance in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer according to cdh1 mutation status.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) accounts for 1% of gastric cancer cases. for patients with a germline cdh1 mutation, risk-reducing gastrectomy is recommended. however, for those delaying surgery or for families with no causative mutation identified, regular endoscopy is advised. this study aimed to determine the yield of signet ring cell carcinoma (srcc) foci in individuals with a cdh1 pathogenic variant compared with those without and how this varies with successive endoscopies. patients fulfilling hdgc criteria were recruited to a prospective longitudinal cohort study. endoscopy was performed according to a strict protocol with visual inspection followed by focal lesion and random biopsy sampling to detect foci of srcc. survival analysis determined progression to finding of srcc according to cdh1 mutation status. the european organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire core 30 and 36-item short form health survey questionnaires assessed quality of life before surveillance and each endoscopy. eighty-five individuals fulfilling hdgc criteria underwent 201 endoscopies; 54 (63.5%) tested positive for cdh1 mutation. srcc yield was 61.1% in cdh1 mutation carriers compared with 9.7% in noncarriers, and mutation-positive patients had a 10-fold risk of srcc on endoscopy compared with those with no mutation detected (p < .0005). yield of srcc decreased substantially with subsequent endoscopies. surveillance was associated with improved psychological health. srcc foci are prevalent in cdh1 mutation carriers and can be detected at endoscopy using a standardized, multiple biopsy sampling protocol. decreasing yield over time suggests that the frequency of endoscopy might be reduced. for patients with no cdh1 pathogenic variant detected, the cost-to-benefit ratio needs to be assessed in view of the low yield.	-1
"prevalence and spectrum of germline mutations of the p53 gene among patients with sarcoma.  recent studies have identified germline mutations of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene in families with the li-fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by a high risk of sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, breast cancer, and other tumors. in this report, we address the possibility that some sporadic sarcomas may be associated with new germline mutations of the p53 gene, which would not be manifested as familial cancer unless the patient survived to reproduce. we studied dna from peripheral leukocytes of 196 patients with sarcoma and from 200 controls. of the 196 patients with sarcoma, 15 were selected because they had had multiple primary cancers or had a family history of cancer. the entire coding sequence and splice junctions of the p53 gene were analyzed for mutations. eight germline mutations were found, three in patients with no known family history of cancer and five in patients with an unusual personal or family history of cancer. four mutations caused amino acid substitutions, and four caused stop codons. these mutations were not present in any of the 200 controls. new germline mutations of the p53 gene are rare among patients with ""sporadic"" sarcoma but may be common in patients with sarcoma whose background includes either multiple primary cancers or a family history of cancer. diverse mutations of this gene were associated with an increased likelihood of cancer; hence, the entire gene should be considered a target for heritable mutation. it appears that the group of patients with cancer who carry germline mutations of the p53 gene is more diverse than is suggested by the clinical definition of the li-fraumeni syndrome. the identification of carriers could be of substantial clinical importance."	-1
identification of eight novel mutations of the acid alpha-glucosidase gene causing the infantile or juvenile form of glycogen storage disease type ii.  glycogen-storage disease type ii (gsdii; omim #232300), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the glycogen hydrolysis enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (acid gaa; acid maltase, ec. 3.2.10.20), results in the accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome. we performed a molecular genetic study on 29 patients with infantile-onset glycogen-storage disease type ii (gsdii), 6 with juvenile-onset gsdii and one carrier for gsdii. seventeen different mutations were identified among them; 8 were novel mutations: c.421c > a (p.l141m), c.872t > c (p.l291p), c.893a > c (p.y298s), c.1375g > a (p.d459n), c.1437g > c (p.k479n), c.1509_1511del (p.a504del), c.1960t > c (p.s654p), and c.2174g > c (p.r725p). one of the mutations identified, c.2238g > c (p.w746c), which was a sequence change of unknown pathogenic significance causing diminished enzyme activity,was found homozygously in a juvenile-onset patient. we also found a juvenile-onset patient with homozygote c.1935c > a mutation which was frequently found in infantile-onset patients. in addition to mutations, we also identified 14 new polymorphisms in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene. the genotype/phenotype correlations indicated that c.2238g > c (p.w746c) is correlated with juvenile- onset gsdii and that c.872t > c (p.l291p) and c.1411_1414del (p.e471fsx5) are correlated with infantile-onset gsdii. mutational analysis of gaa is useful in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of the disease.	-1
evaluation of patients and families with concern for predispositions to hematologic malignancies within the hereditary hematologic malignancy clinic (hhmc).  although multiple predispositions to hematologic malignancies exist, evaluations for hereditary cancer syndromes (hcs) are underperformed by most hematologist/oncologists. criteria for initiating hcs evaluation are poorly defined, and results of genetic testing for hereditary hematologic malignancies have not been systematically reported. from april 2014 to august 2015, 67 patients were referred to the hereditary hematologic malignancy clinic (hhmc). referral reasons included (1) bone marrow failure or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients ? 50 years, (2) evaluation for germ-line inheritance of identified runx1, gata2, or cebpa mutations on targeted next-generation sequencing panels, and (3) strong personal and/or family history of malignancy. cultured skin fibroblasts were utilized for germ-line dna in all patients with hematologic malignancy. eight patients (12%) were clinically diagnosed with a hcs: 4 patients with runx1-related familial platelet disorder (fpd)/acute myeloid leukemia (aml), and 1 patient each with dyskeratosis congenita, fanconi anemia, germ-line ddx41, and li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs). two patients with concern for fpd/aml and lfs, respectively, had runx1 and tp53 variants of unknown significance. additionally, 4 patients with prior hcs diagnosis (1 lfs, 3 fpd/aml) were referred for further evaluation and surveillance. in this hhmc-referred hematologic malignancy cohort, hcs was confirmed in 12 patients (18%). hcs identification provides insight for improved and individualized treatment, as well as screening/surveillance opportunities for family members. the hhmc has facilitated hcs diagnosis; with increased clinical awareness of hematologic malignancy predisposition syndromes, more patients who may benefit from evaluation can be identified. mutation panels intended for prognostication may provide increased clinical suspicion for germ-line testing.	-1
targeted sequencing identifies novel variants involved in autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss in qatari families.  hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a very high genetic heterogeneity. in the qatari population the role of gjb2, the worldwide hhl major player, seems to be quite limited compared to caucasian populations. in this study we analysed 18 qatari families affected by non-syndromic hearing loss using a targeted sequencing approach that allowed us to analyse 81 genes simultaneously. thanks to this approach, 50% of these families (9 out of 18) resulted positive for the presence of likely causative alleles in 6 different genes: cdh23, myo6, gjb6, otof, tmc1 and otoa. in particular, 4 novel alleles were detected while the remaining ones were already described to be associated to hhl in other ethnic groups. molecular modelling has been used to further investigate the role of novel alleles identified in cdh23 and tmc1 genes demonstrating their crucial role in ca2+ binding and therefore possible functional role in proteins. present study showed that an accurate molecular diagnosis based on next generation sequencing technologies might largely improve molecular diagnostics outcome leading to benefits for both genetic counseling and definition of recurrence risk.	-1
a previously undescribed mutation within the tetramerisation domain of tp53 in a family with li-fraumeni syndrome.  we report details of a family with classic li-fraumeni syndrome in which there is a mutation in codon 344 of the tumour suppressor gene tp53. codon 344 is a key residue within the tetramerisation domain, and the amino acid substitution of a proline for a leucine is predicted to have profound implications for tetramerisation and potentially dna binding. this is the first report of a mutation at this residue in either sporadic tumours or in the germline and the first report of a germline mutation within the tetramerisation domain. the family does not appear to be remarkable in the spectrum of tumours, and there is loss of the wild-type allele in a leiomyosarcoma from the proband. a cell line has been established from the tumour of the proband and cytogenetic and molecular studies carried out, providing an extensive analysis in this family.	-1
exome sequencing covers >98% of mutations identified on targeted next generation sequencing panels.  with the expanded availability of next generation sequencing (ngs)-based clinical genetic tests, clinicians seeking to test patients with mendelian diseases must weigh the superior coverage of targeted gene panels with the greater number of genes included in whole exome sequencing (wes) when considering their first-tier testing approach. here, we use an in silico analysis to predict the analytic sensitivity of wes using pathogenic variants identified on targeted ngs panels as a reference. corresponding nucleotide positions for 1533 different alterations classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic identified on targeted ngs multi-gene panel tests in our laboratory were interrogated in data from 100 randomly-selected clinical wes samples to quantify the sequence coverage at each position. pathogenic variants represented 91 genes implicated in hereditary cancer, x-linked intellectual disability, primary ciliary dyskinesia, marfan syndrome/aortic aneurysms, cardiomyopathies and arrhythmias. when assessing coverage among 100 individual wes samples for each pathogenic variant (153,300 individual assessments), 99.7% (n = 152,798) would likely have been detected on wes. all pathogenic variants had at least some coverage on exome sequencing, with a total of 97.3% (n = 1491) detectable across all 100 individuals. for the remaining 42 pathogenic variants, the number of wes samples with adequate coverage ranged from 35 to 99. factors such as location in gc-rich, repetitive, or homologous regions likely explain why some of these alterations were not detected across all samples. to validate study findings, a similar analysis was performed against coverage data from 60,706 exomes available through the exome aggregation consortium (exac). results from this validation confirmed that 98.6% (91,743,296/93,062,298) of pathogenic variants demonstrated adequate depth for detection. results from this in silico analysis suggest that exome sequencing may achieve a diagnostic yield similar to panel-based testing for mendelian diseases.	-1
molecular characterization of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in chile. mutations in brief no. 243. online.  both the haplotype distribution and the mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene has been defined for the chilean phenylketonuria (pku) population. mutation analysis was performed using a combined approach of screening for common european and oriental mutations and application of the dgge scanning method in the remaining uncharacterized alleles. a total of 16 different mutations have been identified, including two novel ones, q232x and ivs11nt5. the most frequent mutations were ivs10nt-11 and v388m present both in the 13% of the mutant chromosomes. the rest of the mutations are rare. the haplotype association including vntr and str alleles, was examined to investigated the origin and distribution of pah alleles in chile. our results are consistent with southern europeans as the major source of pah mutations in latin america. however, we have also detected mutations from east and central europe, such ivs12nt1, r408w and r252w. it is clear that the pku mutation present in each latin american country varies with the demographic profile and specific mutation scanning is necessary in each population both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. the correlation between the genotypes and the phenotypes is consistent with the emerging pattern of mutation severity deduced from previous studies in related populations.	-1
functional assessment of variants in the tsc1 and tsc2 genes identified in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex.  the effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling. one option is to perform functional tests to assess whether the variants affect protein function. we have used this strategy to characterize variants identified in the tsc1 and tsc2 genes in individuals with, or suspected of having, tuberous sclerosis complex (tsc). here we present an overview of our functional studies on 45 tsc1 and 107 tsc2 variants. using a standardized protocol we classified 16 tsc1 variants and 70 tsc2 variants as pathogenic. in addition we identified eight putative splice site mutations (five tsc1 and three tsc2). the remaining 24 tsc1 and 34 tsc2 variants were classified as probably neutral.	1
mutation analysis of pah gene and characterization of a recurrent deletion mutation in korean patients with phenylketonuria.  phenylketonuria (pku; mim 261600) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah; ec 1.14.16.1). point mutations in the pah gene are known to cause pku in various ethnic groups, and large deletions or duplications account for up to 3% of the pah mutations in some ethnic groups. however, a previous study could not identify approximately 14% of the mutant alleles by sequence analysis in korean patients with pku, which suggests that large deletions or duplication might be frequent causes of pku in koreans. to test this hypothesis, we performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) for the identification of uncharacterized mutant alleles after pah sequence analysis of 33 unrelated korean patients with pku. bi-directional sequencing of the pah exons and flanking intronic regions revealed 27 different mutations, including four novel mutations (two missense and two deletion mutations), comprising 57/66 (86%) mutant alleles. mlpa identified a large deletion that encompassed exons 5 and 6 in four patients, another large deletion that extended from exon 4 to exon 7 in one patient, and a duplication of exon 4 in one patient. chromosomal walking characterized the deletion breakpoint of the most common large deletion that involved exons 5 and 6 (c.456_706+138del). the present study shows that the allelic frequency of exon deletion or duplication is 9% (6/66) in korean pku patients, which suggests that these mutations may be frequent causes of pku in korean subjects.	-1
mutation of arg723gly in beta-myosin heavy chain gene in five chinese families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a form of cardiomyopathy with an autosomal dominant inherited disease, which is caused by mutations in at least one of the sarcomeric protein genes. mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-mhc) are the most common cause of hcm. this study was to reveal the disease-causing gene mutations in chinese population with hcm, and to analyze the correlation between the genotype and phenotype. the exons 3 to 26 of myh7 were amplified by pcr, and the pcr products were sequenced in five non-kin hcm patients. a 17-year-old patient was detected to be an arg723gly mutation carrier. then his family was gene-screened, and the correlation between genotype and phenotype was analyzed. the mutation of arg723gly in a chinese family with hcm was detected for the first time. with a c-g transversion in nucleotide 13,619 of the myh7 gene, located at the essential light chain interacting region in s1, the replacement of arginine by glycine took place at amino acid residue 723. a two-dimensional echocardiogram showed moderate asymmetrical septal hypertrophy with left atria enlargement. there was no obstruction in the left ventricular outflow tract. in his family, a total of 13 individuals were diagnosed hcm and 5 of them were dead of congestive heart failure at a mean age of 66-year-old. eight living members were all detected to carry the mutation, in which 3 developed progressive heart failure. moreover, the heart function of the people evidently deteriorates when their age are older than 50. the mutation and the disease show co-separated. the arg723gly mutation is a malignant type. in chinese the mutation has the similar characters to the former report but has low degree malignant.	-1
childhood adrenocortical carcinoma as a sentinel cancer for detecting families with germline tp53 mutations.  li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant disorder where affected individuals carry a 50% risk of developing cancer before 30 years of age. it is most commonly associated with mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, tp53. adrenocortical carcinoma (acc) is a very rare paediatric cancer, and up to 80% of affected children are found to carry germline tp53 mutations. hence, we propose using childhood acc incidence as selection criteria for referral for tp53 mutation testing, independent of familial cancer history. under the auspices of the malaysian society of paediatric haematology-oncology, four eligible children diagnosed with acc over a 30-month study period were referred for mutation testing. three had a germline tp53 mutation. subsequent tp53 testing in relatives showed two inherited mutations and one de novo mutation. these findings strongly support paediatric acc as a useful sentinel cancer for initiating a germline tp53/lfs detection programme, particularly in countries where the lack of structured oncogenetic practice precludes the identification of families with lfs features.	-1
a low prevalence of myh7/mybpc3 mutations among familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients in india.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting the cardiac muscle and exhibits varied clinical symptoms because of genetic heterogeneity. several disease causing genes have been identified and most code for sarcomere proteins. in the current study, we have carried out clinical and molecular analysis of fhc patients from india. fhc was detected using echocardiography and by analysis of clinical symptoms and family history. disease causing mutations in the ?-cardiac myosin heavy chain (myh7) and myosin binding protein c3 (mybpc3) genes were identified using polymerase chain reaction-deoxyribose nucleic acid (pcr-dna) sequencing. of the 55 patient samples screened, mutations were detected in only nineteen in the two genes; mybpc3 mutations were identified in 12 patients while myh7 mutations were identified in five, two patients exhibited double heterozygosity. all four myh7 mutations were missense mutations, whereas only 3/9 mypbc3 mutations were missense mutations. four novel mutations in mybpc3 viz. c.456delc, c.2128g>a (p.e710k), c.3641g>a (p.w1214x), and c.3656t>c (p.l1219p) and one in myh7 viz. c.965c>t (p.s322f) were identified. a majority of missense mutations affected conserved amino acid residues and were predicted to alter the structure of the corresponding mutant proteins. the study has revealed a greater frequency of occurrence of mybpc3 mutations when compared to myh7 mutations.	-1
germline p53 mutations in a cohort with childhood sarcoma: sex differences in cancer risk.  to characterize cancer risk in heterozygous p53 mutation carriers, we analyzed cancer incidence in 56 germline p53 mutation carriers and 3,201 noncarriers from 107 kindreds ascertained through patients with childhood soft-tissue sarcoma who were treated at the university of texas m. d. anderson cancer center. we systematically followed members in these kindreds for cancer incidence for >20 years and evaluated their p53 gene status. we found seven kindreds with germline p53 mutations that include both missense and truncation mutation types. kaplan-meier analysis showed similar cancer risks between 21 missense and 35 truncation p53 mutation carriers (log-rank chi(2)=0.04; p=.84). we found a significantly higher cancer risk in female carriers than in male carriers (log-rank chi(2)=12.1; p<.001), a difference not explained by an excess of sex-specific cancer. the calculated standardized incidence ratio (sir) showed that mutation carriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was much higher than that for the general population (sir = 41.1; 95% confidence interval [ci] 29.9-55.0) whereas noncarriers had a risk for all types of cancer that was similar to that in the general population (sir = 0.9; 95% ci 0.8-1.0). the calculated sirs showed a >100-fold higher risk of sarcoma, female breast cancer, and hematologic malignancies for the p53 mutation carriers and agreed with the findings of an earlier segregation analysis based on the same cohort. these results quantitatively illustrated the spectrum of cancer risk in germline p53 mutation carriers and will provide valuable reference for the evaluation and treatment of patients with cancer.	-1
the genotype-phenotype correlation in pompe disease.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that is caused by acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency and is due to pathogenic sequence variations in the corresponding gaa gene. the correlation between genotypes and phenotypes is strict, in that patients with the most severe phenotype, classic infantile pompe disease, have two pathogenic mutations, one in each gaa allele, that prevent the formation of gaa or totally obliterates its function. all patients with less progressive phenotypes have at least one sequence variation that allows normal or low level synthesis of gaa leading to the formation of analytically measurable, low level gaa activity in most cases. there is an overall trend of finding higher gaa enzyme levels in patients with onset of symptoms in adulthood when compared to patients who show clinical manifestations in early childhood, aged 0-5 years, with a rapidly progressive course, but who lack the severe characteristics of classic infantile pompe disease. however, several cases have been reported of adult-onset disease with very low gaa activity, which in all those cases corresponds with the gaa genotype. the clinical diversity observed within a large group of patients with functionally the same gaa genotype and the same c.-32-13c > t haplotype demonstrates that modifying factors can have a substantial effect on the clinical course of pompe disease, disturbing the gaa genotype-phenotype correlation. the present day challenge is to identify these factors and explore them as therapeutic targets.	1
screening e-cadherin in gastric cancer families reveals germline mutations only in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer kindred.  the international gastric cancer linkage consortium (igclc) predicted that up to 25% of families fulfilling the criteria for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) would harbor cdh1 germline mutations. this was based on observations from the low number of diffuse gastric cancer families described at the time, and its validation would require analysis of larger numbers. here we report the results of germline cdh1 mutation screening in 39 kindred with familial aggregation of gastric cancer, a subset of which fulfills the criteria defined by the igclc for hdgc. cdh1 germline mutations were detected in four of 11 (36.4%) hdgc families. no mutations were identified in 63.6% of hdgc families or in kindred with familial aggregation of gastric cancer not fulfilling criteria for hdgc. these results add support to the evidence that only hdgc families harbor germline mutations in cdh1 and that genes other than cdh1 remain to be identified.	-1
sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: genetic profile in a portuguese population.  sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has heterogeneous phenotypic expressions, of which sudden cardiac death is the most feared. a genetic diagnosis is essential to identify subjects at risk in each family. the spectrum of disease-causing mutations in the portuguese population is unknown. seventy-seven unrelated probands with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were systematically screened for mutations by pcr and sequencing of five sarcomeric genes: mybpc3, myh7, tnnt2, tnni3 and myl2. familial cosegregation analysis was performed in most patients. thirty-four different mutations were identified in 41 (53%) index patients, 71% with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the most frequently involved gene was mybpc3 (66%) with 22 different mutations (8 novel) in 27 patients, followed by myh7 (22%), tnnt2 (12%) and tnni3 (2.6%). in three patients (7%), two mutations were found in mybpc3 and/or myh7. additionally, 276 relatives were screened, leading to the identification of a mean of three other affected relatives for each pedigree with the familial form of the disease. disease-associated mutations were identified mostly in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, corroborating the idea that rarely studied genes may be implicated in sporadic forms. private mutations are the rule, mybpc3 being the most commonly involved gene. mutations in mybpc3 and myh7 accounted for most cases of sarcomere-related disease. multiple mutations in these genes may occur, which highlights the importance of screening both. the detection of novel mutations strongly suggests that all coding regions should be systematically screened. genotyping in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy enables a more precise diagnosis of the disease, with implications for risk stratification and genetic counseling.	-1
mutations in the human melanocortin-4 receptor gene associated with severe familial obesity disrupts receptor function through multiple molecular mechanisms.  mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (mc4r) represent the commonest monogenic cause of human obesity. however, information regarding the precise effects of such mutations on receptor function is very limited. we examined the functional properties of 12 different mutations in human mc4r that result in severe, familial, early-onset obesity. of the nine missense mutants studied, four were completely unable to generate camp in response to ligand and five were partially impaired. four showed evidence of impaired cell surface expression and six of reduced binding affinity for ligand. one mutation in the c-terminal tail, i316s, showed reduced affinity for alpha-msh but retained normal affinity for the antagonist agrp. none of the mutations inhibited signaling through co-transfected wild-type receptors. thus, in the most comprehensive study to date of the functional properties of naturally occurring mc4r mutations we have (1) established that defective expression on the cell surface is a common mechanism impairing receptor function, (2) identified mutations which specifically affect ligand binding affinity thus aiding the definition of receptor structure-function relationships, (3) provided evidence against the notion that these receptor mutants act as dominant-negatives, and (4) identified a potentially novel molecular mechanism of receptor dysfunction whereby a mutation alters the relative affinities of a receptor for its natural agonist versus antagonist.	1
phenotypes in three pedigrees with autosomal dominant obesity caused by haploinsufficiency mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene.  recently, haploinsufficiency mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (mc4-r) were detected which were assumed to lead to the phenotype of extreme obesity. previously, we detected three obese carriers among 306 index patients. here we describe the detection of one haploinsufficiency carrier in an additional study group of 186 obese individuals. we subsequently genotyped and phenotyped 43 family members of these four index patients, two of whom were second-degree cousins. a total of 19 carriers were identified. extreme obesity was the predominating phenotype. however, moderate obesity occurred in three of the carriers. no other specific phenotypic abnormalities were detected. female haploinsufficiency carriers were heavier than male carriers in the respective families, a finding similar to findings in mc4-r-knockout mice. in conclusion, our data fully support the etiologic role of mc4-r haploinsufficiency mutations in obesity.	-1
tp53 germline mutations in portugal and genetic modifiers of age at cancer onset.  the li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is a rare, autosomal dominant disease caused by tp53 germline mutations. this study aimed to characterize the tp53 mutational spectrum in patients suspected to have lfs in portugal and to evaluate the influence of the mdm2-snp309 and tp53-72arg variants and of telomere length on age of tumor onset. probands were primarily selected using the classical lfs criteria (two cases) or the more sensitive chompret li-fraumeni-like (lfl) criteria (13 cases), but 12 additional patients that did not comply with those lfs or lfl criteria were included in the analysis based on clinical suspicion (lfs suspects). nine of the 27 probands (33.3%) presented germline tp53 mutations, two of them occurring de novo and two of them being novel. three of the nine tp53 mutations were found in families that did not comply with any of the commonly used criteria for tp53 testing, leaving room to recommend the use of less stringent criteria. an association was found between the presence of the tp53-72arg (but not the mdm2-snp309) variant and earlier age of onset in tp53 carriers. a negative correlation between telomere length and age of cancer onset was found in patients with germline tp53 mutation, whereas no such correlation was found in controls or in patients with wild-type tp53.	-1
focal sclerosis of semicircular canals with severe dfna9 hearing impairment caused by a p51s coch-mutation: is there a link?  focal sclerosis of one or more semicircular canals on computed tomographic (ct) scans and a corresponding signal loss on magnetic resonance (mr) imaging are radiologic lesions that are linked to patients who are suffering from advanced otovestibular impairment caused by hereditary dfna9 hearing loss. dfna9 is a hereditary hearing loss that is characterized by late-onset progressive imbalance and hearing deterioration, caused by mutations in the coch gene. to date, no radiologic lesions have been associated with this condition. a retrospective chart review tertiary referral center the radiologic data of 9 patients who presented between 2007 and 2012 with otovestibular deterioration caused by a mutation in the coch gene were reviewed. all 9 subjects were carriers of the same c.151c > t, p.pro51ser (p51s) - missense mutation in the coch gene. in 8 of them similar sclerotic lesions and/or narrowing were demonstrated in one or more semicircular canals on computed tomography ct scan, with a signal loss at corresponding areas on t2-weighted magnetic resonance (mr) images. in 1 patient, the posterior part of the vestibule was also affected. the posterior canals were affected in most cases (58%), compared with the superior (21%) and lateral canals (16%) or the vestibule (5%). only 68.4% of the lesions on mr images were also visible on ct scans, suggesting a fibrotic process without calcification. ears presenting radiologic lesions showed significantly more severe hearing loss (median pta 104 db hl) compared with unaffected ears (58 db hl). eight of 9 subjects with the same p51s mutation in the coch gene showed similar radiologic lesions, affecting the pscc in the majority of the cases. these radiologic abnormalities occurred in more advanced stages of the otovestibular deterioration, supporting the hypothesis that these lesions might represent the end phase of a low-grade chronic inflammation or protein deposition. a new phenotypic and characteristic radiologic feature of dfna9 has been discovered.	-1
prevalence and distribution of sarcomeric gene mutations in japanese patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is the most prevalent hereditary cardiac disease. although there are several reports on the systematic screening of mutations in the disease-causing genes in european and american populations, only limited information is available for asian populations, including japanese. genetic screening of disease-associated mutations in 8 genes for sarcomeric proteins, myh7, mybpc3, myl2, myl3, tnnt2, tnni3, tpm1, and actc, was performed by direct sequencing in 112 unrelated japanese proband patients with familial hcm; 37 different mutations, including 13 novel ones in 5 genes, myh7, mybpc3, tnnt2, tnni3, and tpm1, were identified in 49 (43.8%) patients. among them, 3 carried compound heterozygous mutations in mybpc3 or tnnt2. the frequency of patients carrying the mybpc3, myh7, and tnnt2 mutations were 19.6%, 10.7%, and 8.9%, respectively, and the most frequently affected genes in the northeastern and southwestern parts of japan were mybpc3 and myh7, respectively. several mutations were found in multiple unrelated proband patients, for which the geographic distribution suggested founder effects of the mutations. this study demonstrated the frequency and distribution of mutations in a large cohort of familial hcm in japan.	-1
the spectrum of phenylalanine variations under tetrahydrobiopterin load in subjects affected by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  a fall in blood phenylalanine (phe) after tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) administration is a common trait in phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah, ec 1.14.16.1) deficiency (mckusick 261600). to explore the extent and biological correlates of this phenomenon we studied: (a) the spectrum of bh(4) response in patients with pah deficiency; (b) the variability of bh(4) response according to the severity of the biochemical phenotype; and (c) the variability of the response to bh(4) in subjects with the same genotype. fifty pah-deficient subjects (age 1 month-35 years) were enrolled for the study (5 with mild hyperphenylalaninaemia (mhphe), 15 with mild phenylketonuria (mpku) and 30 with classic phenylketonuria (cpku) and underwent an identical schedule of blood samplings 24 h before and after oral bh(4) challenge (6(r)-bh4, 20 mg/kg per day), leaving phe intake unchanged. the effect of bh(4) on blood phe concentration was evaluated according to the percent decrease of phe during the 24 h following the challenge (criterion a), and as variation exceeding the individual variability of blood phe (criterion b). the number of bh(4)-responders according to criterion b was 31 (including all the 14 detected by criterion a): 17 out of 30 cpku (57%), 9 out of 15 mpku (60%), and all the mhphe subjects (chi(2) = 3.45, df = 2, p = 0.178). the effect of bh(4) showed a large interindividual variability unrelated to diagnostic classification, basal value of blood phe, maximum percentage of phe reduction, phe intake, and genotype. some inconsistencies were found in patients with identical genotype. the first responsive case homozygous for the severe r408w mutation was found. two new mutations, y387x and g352c, were identified (the former was bh(4)-responsive), and the responsiveness of three already reported mutations (r261q, d338y, t92i) was substantiated.	-1
prevalence of monogenic diabetes in the population-based norwegian childhood diabetes registry.  monogenic diabetes (md) might be misdiagnosed as type 1 diabetes. the prevalence of md among children with apparent type 1 diabetes has not been established. our aim was to estimate the prevalence of common forms of md in childhood diabetes. we investigated 2,756 children aged 0-14 years with newly diagnosed diabetes who had been recruited to the nationwide population-based norwegian childhood diabetes registry (ncdr), from july 2002 to march 2012. completeness of ascertainment was 91%. children diagnosed with diabetes who were under12 months of age were screened for mutations in kcnj11, abcc8 and ins. children without gad and protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein antibodies were screened in two ways. those who had a parent with diabetes were screened for mutations in hnf1a, hnf4a, ins and mt-tl1. children with hba1c <7.5% (<58 mmol/mol) and no insulin requirement were screened for mutations in gck. finally, we searched the norwegian mody registry for children with genetically verified md. we identified 15 children harbouring a mutation in hnf1a, nine with one in gck, four with one in kcnj11, one child with a mutation in ins and none with a mutation in mt-tl1. the minimum prevalence of md in the ncdr was therefore 1.1%. by searching the norwegian mody registry, we found 24 children with glucokinase-mody, 15 of whom were not present in the ncdr. we estimated the minimum prevalence of md among norwegian children to be 3.1/100,000. this is the first prevalence study of the common forms of md in a nationwide, population-based registry of childhood diabetes. we found that 1.1% of patients in the norwegian childhood diabetes registry had md.	-1
molecular genetic analysis of 1053 danish individuals with clinical signs of familial hypercholesterolemia.  the lipid disorder familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) predisposes to cardiovascular disease. with a prevalence of approximately one in 500 in the general caucasian population, fh is one of the most frequent single-gene disorders. as the mutational spectra vary between populations, it is crucial to identify the mutations in a given population in order to implement a molecular genetic screening strategy. a total of 1053 referred individuals with clinical signs of fh were investigated, and mutations were identified in 425 individuals. fifty-four different mutations were identified, of which 13 are novel. the five most frequent mutations accounted for 56.3% of all disease-causing mutations. the majority of the remaining mutations were of a private nature only encountered in single families. in this study, a reliable molecular genetic screening protocol was established, and the relevance of performing presymptomatic genetic analysis as part of a preventive strategy was documented. we have acquired knowledge of the mutational spectra in the danish population and thus will be able to trace mutations in their relatives through our index cases.	-1
distinct and novel slc26a4/pendrin mutations in chinese and u.s. patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss.  mutations of the human slc26a4/pds gene constitute the most common cause of syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss. definition of the slc26a4 mutation spectrum among different populations with sensorineural hearing loss is important for development of optimal genetic screening services for congenital hearing impairment. we screened for slc26a4 mutations among chinese and u.s. subjects with hearing loss, using denaturing hplc (dhplc) and direct dna sequencing. fifty-two of 55 chinese subjects with deafness accompanied by enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (eva) exhibited at least one mutant slc26a4 allele, whereas slc26a4 mutations were found in only 2 of 116 deaf chinese patients without eva. the spectrum of slc26a4 mutations differed among chinese and u.s. subjects and included 10 previously unreported slc26a4 variants: 4 in the chinese population (p.e303q, p.x329, p.x467, p.x573) and 6 in the u.s. population (p.v250a, p.d266n, p.f354s, p.d697a, p.k715n, p.e737d). among the seven novel in-frame missense mutations, five encoded slc26a4 proteins with substantially reduced cl(-)/anion exchange activity as expressed and measured in xenopus oocytes, but four of these were sufficiently active to allow study of anion selectivity. the only mutant polypeptide exhibiting complete loss of anion exchange function, p.e303q, was expressed at or near the oocyte surface at near-wild-type levels. two variants, p.f354s and p.e737d, displayed selective reduction in relative rate of cl(-)/hco(3)(-) exchange compared with similarly measured rates of cl(-)/cl(-) and cl(-)/i(-) exchange. our data show that mutation analysis of the slc26a4 gene is of high diagnostic yield among subjects with deafness and bilateral eva in both china and the u.s. however, the pathogenicity of monoallelic slc26a4 gene variants in patients with hearing loss remains unclear in many instances.	-1
fabry disease in a japanese population-molecular and biochemical characteristics.  we had experienced 117 japanese fabry patients (72 males and 45 females) from 1977 to 2006, and then we generated an improved fabry analysis system in 2007 and have found 196 ones (95 males and 101 females) since then. in this study, we summarized the data of the patients and tried to elucidate the molecular and biochemical characteristics of japanese fabry patients. gene analysis revealed various gla mutations, including missense mutations (56.5%, 48 types); nonsense mutations (15.9%, 13 types); deletions (12.6%, 13 types); splicing defects (10.1%, 6 types); insertions (1.0%, 2 types), and insertions/deletions (0.5%, 1 type), in the patients that were tested. amino acid substitutions resulting from the missense mutations found in the classic form patients tended to be localized in the core of the gla protein, and those in the later-onset ones in the peripheral region. the most commonly identified pathogenic mutations arec.888g>a (p.m296i),c.936+919g>a,c.679c>t (p.r227x),c.335g>a (p.r112h),c.334c>t (p.r112c), andc.902g>a (p.r301q). among them,c.888g>a (p.m296i) is unique to japanese fabry patients. on the other hand,c.936+919g>a is a variant that has been frequently detected in taiwan chinese fabry patients, andc.335g>a (p.r112h) in various countries. these are found in later-onset patients, andc.679c>t (p.r227x) andc.334c>t (p.r112c) classic ones.c.902g>a (p.r301q) is found in both classic and later-onset form patients. a possible functional polymorphism,c.196g>c (p.e66q), was identified in 0.4% of the subjects who underwent high-risk screening. the biochemical findings including leukocyte ?-galactosidase a activity, plasma globotriaosylsphingosine level and urinary globotriaosylceramide in the individual phenotypic groups well reflected the phenotypic differences in this disease. the results will be useful for understanding the basis of fabry disease in japan.	1
prevalence of mutations and functional analyses of melanocortin 4 receptor variants identified among 750 men with juvenile-onset obesity.  mutations in the gene encoding the melanocortin 4 receptor (mc4r) are associated with the most common monogenic form of obesity. we examined 750 danish men with juvenile-onset obesity (body mass index 33.3 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)) and 706 control subjects (body mass index 21.4 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2)) for mutations in mc4r. a total of 14 different mutations were identified of which two, ala219val and leu325phe, were novel variants. the variant receptor, leu325phe, was unable to bind [nle4,d-phe7]-alphamsh, whereas the ala219val variant showed a significantly impaired melanotan ii induction of camp, compared with the wild-type receptor. the remaining 11 mutations have previously been reported, but selected mc4r variants were further characterized in vitro in the present study. a previously identified nonsense mutation, tyr35stop, had a relatively high allele frequency (0.6%), suggesting a possible founder effect in the danish population. this study shows a carrier frequency of 2.5% of pathogenic mutations in the mc4r gene in a population-based study of obese men. thus, variation in this gene is the most common known specific genetic cause of obesity among scandinavian men.	1
usher's syndrome type ii: a comparative study of genetic mutations and vestibular system evaluation.  objective usher's syndrome type ii (ush2) is characterized by moderate to profound congenital hearing loss, later onset of retinitis pigmentosa, and normal vestibular function. recently, a study investigating the vestibular function of ush2 patients demonstrated a pathologic response to vestibular tests. in this cross-sectional study we performed vestibular tests of a group patients with genetic diagnosis of ush2 syndrome to demonstrate if vestibular damage is present in ush2 patients. study design cross-sectional study. setting tertiary referral center. subjects and methods mutated genes of 7 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ush2 were evaluated. vestibular function was investigated by audiometry, fitzgerald-hallpike caloric vestibular testing, cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (c-vemps), ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (o-vemps), and video head impulse test (v-hit). results genetic tests confirmed the ush2 diagnosis in 5 of 7 patients examined, with 1 patient reporting a unique mutation on genetic tests. four (80%) of the 5 patients with a genetic diagnosis of ush2 showed pathological o-vemps. two patients (40%) reported bilateral absent or abnormal values of c-vemps. the superior semicircular canal presented a significant deficit in 2 (40%) patients. the same 2 cases showed a pathologic response of the v-hit of the horizontal semicircular canal. finally, the posterior semicircular canal presented a significant deficit in 4 (40.0%) patients. conclusion a vestibular evaluation with vestibular evoked myogenic potentials and v-hit seems to identify latent damage to the vestibular receptors of ush2 patients.	-1
cell biology assessment of glucokinase mutations v62m and g72r in pancreatic beta-cells: evidence for cellular instability of catalytic activity.  mutations in the glucokinase (gk) gene cause defects in blood glucose homeostasis. in some cases (v62m and g72r), the phenotype cannot be explained by altered enzyme kinetics or protein instability. we used transient and stable expression of green fluorescent protein (gfp) gk chimaeras in min6 beta-cells to study the phenotype defect of v62m and g72r. gk activity in lysates of min6 cell lines stably expressing wild-type or mutant gfp gk showed the expected affinity for glucose and response to pharmacological activators, indicating the expression of catalytically active enzymes. min6 cells stably expressing gfp v62m or gfp g72r had a lower gk activity-to-gk immunoreactivity ratio and gk activity-to-gk mrna ratio but not gk immunoreactivity-to-gk mrna ratio than wild-type gfp gk. heterologous expression of liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (pfk2/fdp2) in cell lines increased gk activity for wild-type gk and v62m but not for g72r, whereas expression of liver gk regulatory protein (gkrp) increased gk activity for wild type but not v62m or g72r. lack of interaction of these mutants with gkrp was also evident in hepatocyte transfections from the lack of nuclear accumulation. these results suggest that cellular loss of gk catalytic activity rather than impaired translation or enhanced protein degradation may account for the hyperglycemia in subjects with v62m and g72r mutations.	1
germline mutations in components of the ras signaling pathway in noonan syndrome and related disorders.  ras proteins control a variety of critical cellular processes, and somatic mutations in ras genes (and other members of signaling networks regulated by ras) are common in human malignancies. ras proteins are guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding proteins that cycle between active gtp-bound and inactive guanosine diphosphate (gdp) bound conformations. cancer-associated ras mutations typically alter amino acids g12, g13 or q61. these mutant ras proteins display impaired gtpase activity and are resistant to gtpase activating proteins (gaps). we and others recently discovered novel germline kras mutations in individuals diagnosed with noonan or cardio-facio-cutanous (cfc) syndrome, two clinically overlapping disorders characterized by short stature, distinct facial anomalies, heart defects, and other developmental abnormalities. we found that the mutant k-ras proteins encoded by ns-associated alleles have less pronounced biochemical defects than known ras oncoproteins, which likely explains why these mutations are tolerated in the germline. together with the recent findings of mutations in other members of the ras signaling cascade in cfc syndrome and in costello syndrome, another clinically related disorder, it is now clear that noonan-like features are common phenotypic consequences of systemic deregulation of the ras pathway. the discovery of germline mutations in this group of related genetic disorders underscores the pivotal role of the degree and duration of ras activation in cell fate decisions during embryonic development and morphogenesis.	1
development of a genotyping microarray for usher syndrome.  usher syndrome, a combination of retinitis pigmentosa (rp) and sensorineural hearing loss with or without vestibular dysfunction, displays a high degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity. three clinical subtypes can be distinguished, based on the age of onset and severity of the hearing impairment, and the presence or absence of vestibular abnormalities. thus far, eight genes have been implicated in the syndrome, together comprising 347 protein-coding exons. to improve dna diagnostics for patients with usher syndrome, we developed a genotyping microarray based on the arrayed primer extension (apex) method. allele-specific oligonucleotides corresponding to all 298 usher syndrome-associated sequence variants known to date, 76 of which are novel, were arrayed. approximately half of these variants were validated using original patient dnas, which yielded an accuracy of >98%. the efficiency of the usher genotyping microarray was tested using dnas from 370 unrelated european and american patients with usher syndrome. sequence variants were identified in 64/140 (46%) patients with usher syndrome type i, 45/189 (24%) patients with usher syndrome type ii, 6/21 (29%) patients with usher syndrome type iii and 6/20 (30%) patients with atypical usher syndrome. the chip also identified two novel sequence variants, c.400c>t (p.r134x) in pcdh15 and c.1606t>c (p.c536s) in ush2a. the usher genotyping microarray is a versatile and affordable screening tool for usher syndrome. its efficiency will improve with the addition of novel sequence variants with minimal extra costs, making it a very useful first-pass screening tool.	-1
immune dysregulation in patients with pten hamartoma tumor syndrome: analysis of foxp3 regulatory tcells.  patients with heterozygous germline mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (pten) experience autoimmunity and lymphoid hyperplasia. because regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) pathway is critical for maintaining regulatory t (treg) cell functions, we investigate treg cells in patients with heterozygous germline pten mutations (pten hamartoma tumor syndrome [phts]). patients with phts were assessed for immunologic conditions, lymphocyte subsets, forkhead box p3 (foxp3)+ treg cell levels, and phenotype. to determine the functional importance of phosphatases that control the pi3k pathway, we assessed treg cell induction in vitro, mitochondrial depolarization, and recruitment of pten to the immunologic synapse. autoimmunity and peripheral lymphoid hyperplasia were found in 43% of 79 patients with phts. immune dysregulation in patients with phts included lymphopenia, cd4+ t-cell reduction, and changes in t- and b-cell subsets. although total cd4+foxp3+ treg cell numbers are reduced, frequencies are maintained in the blood and intestine. despite pathogenic pten mutations, the foxp3+ t cells are phenotypically normal. we show that the phosphatase ph domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (phlpp) downstream of pten is highly expressed in normal human treg cells and provides complementary phosphatase activity. phlpp is indispensable for the differentiation of induced treg cells in vitro and treg cell mitochondrial fitness. pten and phlpp form a phosphatase network that is polarized at the immunologic synapse. heterozygous loss of function of pten in human subjects has a significant effect on t- and b-cell immunity. assembly of the pten-phlpp phosphatase network allows coordinated phosphatase activities at the site of t-cell receptor activation, which is important for limiting pi3k hyperactivation in treg cells despite pten haploinsufficiency.	-1
attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli as an indicator of changes in motivation to drink.  heavy drinkers show an attentional bias toward alcohol-related visual cues. a recent study in our laboratory (weafer & fillmore, 2013) showed that alcohol decreases attentional bias among heavy drinkers, suggesting that alcohol satiates motivation to drink in heavy drinkers. little is known, however, about how this satiety effect might change across the time course of the blood alcohol concentration (bac) curve. it is possible that attentional bias may return later in the time course if the satiety effect begins to diminish. the current study tested this hypothesis in a group of high-risk binge drinkers (n = 20). participants completed a visual-probe task to measure their attentional bias and a self-report measure of their desire for alcohol after receiving 0.64 g/kg and 0.0 g/kg alcohol (placebo) during separate dose challenge sessions. the measures were obtained during the ascending limb of the bac curve under alcohol (test 1) and again during the descending limb (test 2) at a comparable bac. the measures also were obtained at the same times following placebo. under alcohol, no attentional bias was observed during test 1, but drinkers reported increased desire to drink. during test 2, attentional bias was evident, but participants reported less desire to drink. attentional bias was not correlated with desire to drink at any time point. following placebo, attentional bias was evident during both tests. these findings show that alcohol causes a temporary reduction of attentional bias among heavy drinkers. these changes do not correspond with their self-reported motivation to drink.	-1
a frameshift mutation in exon 2 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene linked to rflp haplotype 1.  a deletion of a single base in codon 55 (exon 2) of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene has been identified by direct dna sequencing of 94 phenylketonuria (pku) chromosomes. this mutation alters the reading frame so that a stop signal (taa) is generated in codon 60 of the pah gene. haplotype analysis revealed that all pku alleles showing the codon 55 frameshift mutation exhibited haplotype 1. in our panel of dna probes 13% of all mutant haplotype 1 alleles carry this particular mutation. patients who were compound heterozygotes for this deletion and r408w in exon 12, or the splice mutation in intron 12, were affected by severe pku. thus, the clinical data provide additional evidence that haplotype 1 pku alleles carry molecular defects which confer a null phenotype. in addition, we were able to show that the newly detected mutation occurs on alleles of different ethnic background.	-1
functional characterization of the common c.-32-13t>g mutation of gaa gene: identification of potential therapeutic agents.  glycogen storage disease type ii is a lysosomal storage disorder due to mutations of the gaa gene, which causes lysosomal alpha-glucosidase deficiency. clinically, glycogen storage disease type ii has been classified in infantile and late-onset forms. most late-onset patients share the leaky splicing mutation c.-32-13t>g. to date, the mechanism by which the c.-32-13t>g mutation affects the gaa mrna splicing is not fully known. in this study, we demonstrate that the c.-32-13t>g mutation abrogates the binding of the splicing factor u2af65 to the polypyrimidine tract of exon 2 and that several splicing factors affect exon 2 inclusion, although the only factor capable of acting in the c.-32-13 t>g context is the sr protein family member, srsf4 (srp75). most importantly, a preliminary screening using small molecules described to be able to affect splicing profiles, showed that resveratrol treatment resulted in a significant increase of normal spliced gaa mrna, gaa protein content and activity in cells transfected with a mutant minigene and in fibroblasts from patients carrying the c-32-13t>g mutation. in conclusion, this work provides an in-depth functional characterization of the c.-32-13t>g mutation and, most importantly, an in vitro proof of principle for the use of small molecules to rescue normal splicing of c.-32-13t>g mutant alleles.	1
pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant prevalence among the first 10,000 patients referred for next-generation cancer panel testing.  germ-line testing for panels of cancer genes using next-generation sequencing is becoming more common in clinical care. we report our experience as a clinical laboratory testing both well-established, high-risk cancer genes (e.g., brca1/2, mlh1, msh2) as well as more recently identified cancer genes (e.g., palb2, brip1), many of which have increased but less well-defined penetrance. clinical genetic testing was performed on over 10,000 consecutive cases referred for evaluation of germ-line cancer genes, and results were analyzed for frequency of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, and were stratified by testing panel, gene, and clinical history. overall, a molecular diagnosis was made in 9.0% of patients tested, with the highest yield in the lynch syndrome/colorectal cancer panel. in patients with breast, ovarian, or colon/stomach cancer, positive yields were 9.7, 13.4, and 14.8%, respectively. approximately half of the pathogenic variants identified in patients with breast or ovarian cancer were in genes other than brca1/2. the high frequency of positive results in a wide range of cancer genes, including those of high penetrance and with clinical care guidelines, underscores both the genetic heterogeneity of hereditary cancer and the usefulness of multigene panels over genetic tests of one or two genes.genet med 18 8, 823-832.	-1
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is a cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutation of the gene for the cell-to-cell adhesion protein e-cadherin. the syndrome is dominated by predisposition to the histologically diffuse, poorly differentiated form of gastric cancer. it is not associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer, but families may have an elevated risk of lobular breast cancer. here, we review the identified families, mutations, and proposed mechanisms by which e-cadherin loss promotes tumorigenesis.	-1
identification of eleven novel tumor-associated e-cadherin mutations. mutations in brief no. 215. online.  the cell adhesion molecule e-cadherin (cdh1; mim# 192090) has been implicated in numerous cellular functions, ranging from controlling morphogenesis to suppressing tumor invasion. we describe 11 previously unreported somatic e-cadherin mutations in two subgroups of gastric and breast cancer showing markedly reduced homophilic cell-to-cell interactions. using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) and direct sequencing of the entire coding region 5 mutations were detected in diffuse-type gastric cancer specimens. the sequence alterations include 3 missense mutations affecting exons 3, 10, and 12. furthermore, two in-frame deletions were identified removing 63 and 9 base pairs from exon 4 and 5, respectively. in invasive lobular breast cancer 6 e-cadherin mutations were detected after rt-pcr amplification and direct sequencing or using single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis followed by sequencing. in addition to two nonsense mutations affecting exon 2, four out-of-frame deletions removing 115 base pairs (entire exon 2), 224 base pairs (entire exon 3), 8 base pairs from exon 12 or 1 base pair from exon 13 were seen. our report confirms the general principle that in diffuse-type gastric cancer e-cadherin mutations result in structurally altered proteins with possible reduced adhesive functions whereas in invasive lobular breast carcinomas complete loss-of-function mutations are characteristic.	-1
low-density lipoprotein receptor gene mutation analysis and clinical correlation in belgian hypercholesterolaemics.  it is generally believed that patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) have a higher cardiovascular risk than hypercholesterolaemics without a defect in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene. however, no conclusive evidence to support this view has yet been presented. we investigated this aspect in belgian hyperlipidaemics as part of a comprehensive effort to determine the impact of fh in this population. dna samples of 98 unrelated belgian patients with a family history of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolaemia were screened for mutations in the ldlr gene, after exclusion of known mutations causing familial defective apolipoprotein b-100 (fdb). eight of the 22 distinct ldlr gene mutations identified in 27 subjects have not previously been described in other populations. as expected, the mutation-positive patients had a significantly worse lipid profile than the mutation-negative subjects (p<0.05), but this did not correlate with clinical cardiovascular status. in conclusion, the presence of a mutation in the ldlr gene was not a reliable predictor of cardiovascular risk in the hyperlipidaemic subjects included in this study. however, it is possible that prolonged exposure to the high levels of ldl cholesterol in genetically proven fh patients will in future cause a higher incidence of coronary heart disease. our data may reflect the genetic heterogeneity of inherited hypercholesterolaemia, recently shown to be caused by several major genes.	-1
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome: cdh1 mutations and beyond.  e-cadherin (cdh1) is a cancer predisposition gene mutated in families meeting clinically defined hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc). reliable estimates of cancer risk and spectrum in germline mutation carriers are essential for management. for families without cdh1 mutations, genetic-based risk stratification has not been possible, resulting in limited clinical options. to derive accurate estimates of gastric and breast cancer risks in cdh1 mutation carriers and determine if germline mutations in other genes are associated with hdgc. testing for cdh1 germline mutations was performed on 183 index cases meeting clinical criteria for hdgc. penetrance was derived from 75 mutation-positive families from within this and other cohorts, comprising 3858 probands (353 with gastric cancer and 89 with breast cancer). germline dna from 144 hdgc probands lacking cdh1 mutations was screened using multiplexed targeted sequencing for 55 cancer-associated genes. accurate estimates of gastric and breast cancer risks in cdh1 mutation carriers and the relative contribution of other cancer predisposition genes in familial gastric cancers. thirty-one distinct pathogenic cdh1 mutations (14 novel) were identified in 34 of 183 index cases (19%). by the age of 80 years, the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer was 70% (95% ci, 59%-80%) for males and 56% (95% ci, 44%-69%) for females, and the risk of breast cancer for females was 42% (95% ci, 23%-68%). in cdh1 mutation-negative index cases, candidate mutations were identified in 16 of 144 probands (11%), including mutations within genes of high and moderate penetrance: ctnna1, brca2, stk11, sdhb, prss1, atm, msr1, and palb2. this is the largest reported series of cdh1 mutation carriers, providing more precise estimates of age-associated risks of gastric and breast cancer that will improve counseling of unaffected carriers. in hdgc families lacking cdh1 mutations, testing of ctnna1 and other tumor suppressor genes should be considered. clinically defined hdgc families can harbor mutations in genes (ie, brca2) with different clinical ramifications from cdh1. therefore, we propose that hdgc syndrome may be best defined by mutations in cdh1 and closely related genes, rather than through clinical criteria that capture families with heterogeneous susceptibility profiles.	-1
mutations in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (m. pompe) in a patient with an unusual phenotype.  glycogenosis type ii (pompe disease) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). the disease is autosomal recessive inherited and is clinically and genetically heterogenous. the authors describe a 30-year-old woman affected by late-onset pompe disease with vascular affection resembling atherosclerotic angiopathy of the elderly. genetic analysis revealed two novel mutations (ala237val and gly293arg) in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene in this patient.	-1
mutation detection in phenylketonuria by using chemical cleavage of mismatch: importance of using probes from both normal and patient samples.  mrna from a postmortem liver sample of a patient with classical phenylketonuria was examined using the chemical cleavage of mismatch (ccm) method to search for mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase. initial screening identified a heterozygous alteration in exon 2 which changed the encoded amino acid from phenylalanine (ttc) to leucine (ttg) at codon 39 and a polymorphism at codon 430 where the change from ctg to ctc did not alter the encoded leucine. use of the ccm technique also revealed that the control reference clone differed from the published sequence by having a substitution of isoleucine (att) for methionine (atg) at codon 276 and caa rather than cag as the codon for glutamine 232. by using the mrna from the patient instead of the control as the source for the radiolabeled probe for the ccm technique, a second previously undetected alteration was identified in exon 10 where the change from tca to cca at codon 349 altered the amino acid from serine to arginine. judicious choice of probes gives the ccm method the potential to detect close to 100% of single base mutations.	-1
a clinical and genetic analysis of multiple primary cancer referrals to genetics services.  multiple primary malignant tumours (mpmt) are frequently taken as an indicator of potential inherited cancer susceptibility and occur at appreciable frequency both among unselected cancer patients and, particularly, among referrals to cancer genetics services. however, there is a paucity of information on the clinical genetic evaluation of cohorts of mpmt patients representing a variety of tumour types. we ascertained a referral-based series of mpmt cases and describe the patterns of tumours observed. service-based molecular genetic testing had demonstrated a pathogenic germline variant in an inherited cancer gene in fewer than one in four unselected referrals. to assess for evidence of thus far unidentified variants in those who tested negative, comparisons were made with those who tested positive. this revealed considerable overlap between the two groups with respect to clinical characteristics indicative of an inherited cancer syndrome. we therefore proceeded to test a subset of unexplained mpmt cases (n=62) for pathogenic germline variants in tp53 and pten but none were detected. individuals with mpmt may receive negative genetic test results for a number of reasons, which are discussed. many of these may be addressed by the increasing application of next generation sequencing techniques such as inherited cancer gene panels.	-1
systematic analysis of variants related to familial hypercholesterolemia in families with premature myocardial infarction.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an oligogenic disorder characterized by markedly elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ldlc) levels. variants in four genes have been reported to cause the classical autosomal-dominant form of the disease. fh is largely under-diagnosed in european countries. as fh increases the risk for coronary artery disease (cad) and myocardial infarction (mi), it might be specifically overlooked in the large number of such patients. here, we systematically examined the frequency of potential fh-causing variants by exome sequencing in 255 german patients with premature mi and a positive family history for cad. we further performed co-segregation analyses in an average of 5.5 family members per mi patient. in total, we identified 11 potential disease-causing variants that co-segregate within the families, that is, 5% of patients with premature mi and positive cad family history had fh. eight variants were previously reported as disease-causing and three are novel (ldlr.c.811g>a p.(v271i)), pcsk9.c.610g>a (p.(d204n)) and stap1.c.139a>g (p.(t47a))). co-segregation analyses identified multiple additional family members carrying one of these fh variants and the clinical phenotype of either fh (n=2) or fh and premature cad (n=15). however, exome sequencing also revealed that some variants in fh genes, which have been reported to cause fh, do not co-segregate with fh. the data reveal that a large proportion of fh patients escape the diagnosis, even when they have premature mi. hence, systematic molecular-genetic screening for fh in such patients may reveal a substantial number of cases and thereby allow a timely ldlc-lowering in both fh/mi patients as well as their variant-carrying family members.	-1
actionable exomic incidental findings in 6503 participants: challenges of variant classification.  recommendations for laboratories to report incidental findings from genomic tests have stimulated interest in such results. in order to investigate the criteria and processes for assigning the pathogenicity of specific variants and to estimate the frequency of such incidental findings in patients of european and african ancestry, we classified potentially actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (snvs) in all 4300 european- and 2203 african-ancestry participants sequenced by the nhlbi exome sequencing project (esp). we considered 112 gene-disease pairs selected by an expert panel as associated with medically actionable genetic disorders that may be undiagnosed in adults. the resulting classifications were compared to classifications from other clinical and research genetic testing laboratories, as well as with in silico pathogenicity scores. among european-ancestry participants, 30 of 4300 (0.7%) had a pathogenic snv and six (0.1%) had a disruptive variant that was expected to be pathogenic, whereas 52 (1.2%) had likely pathogenic snvs. for african-ancestry participants, six of 2203 (0.3%) had a pathogenic snv and six (0.3%) had an expected pathogenic disruptive variant, whereas 13 (0.6%) had likely pathogenic snvs. genomic evolutionary rate profiling mammalian conservation score and the combined annotation dependent depletion summary score of conservation, substitution, regulation, and other evidence were compared across pathogenicity assignments and appear to have utility in variant classification. this work provides a refined estimate of the burden of adult onset, medically actionable incidental findings expected from exome sequencing, highlights challenges in variant classification, and demonstrates the need for a better curated variant interpretation knowledge base.	-1
life-threatening metabolic alkalosis in pendred syndrome.  pendred syndrome, a combination of sensorineural deafness, impaired organification of iodide in the thyroid and goitre, results from biallelic defects in pendrin (encoded by slc26a4), which transports chloride and iodide in the inner ear and thyroid respectively. recently, pendrin has also been identified in the kidneys, where it is found in the apical plasma membrane of non-?-type intercalated cells of the cortical collecting duct. here, it functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, capable of secreting bicarbonate into the urine. despite this function, patients with pendred syndrome have not been reported to develop any significant acid-base disturbances, except a single previous reported case of metabolic alkalosis in the context of pendred syndrome in a child started on a diuretic. we describe a 46-year-old female with sensorineural deafness and hypothyroidism, who presented with severe hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis during inter-current illnesses on two occasions, and who was found to be homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation (v138f) in slc26a4. her acid-base status and electrolytes were unremarkable when she was well. this case illustrates that, although pendrin is not usually required to maintain acid-base homeostasis under ambient condition, loss of renal bicarbonate excretion by pendrin during a metabolic alkalotic challenge may contribute to life-threatening acid-base disturbances in patients with pendred syndrome.	-1
five novel mutations and two large deletions in a population analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  mutational spectrum of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency was investigated in 107 families (90% of the slovene pku population). the entire coding region of the pah gene was analyzed with dhplc to select the samples where subsequently the automated sequencing analysis was performed. mlpa analysis was performed to identify large deletions, which were later confirmed with long-range pcr. correlations with patients' phenotypes and genotype-based predictions of bh(4)-responsiveness were assessed. altogether, disease-causing mutations were identified on 209 alleles (detection rate 97.7%). a spectrum of 36 different disease-causing mutations was identified: 20 missense mutations (80% of the alleles), eight splicing mutations (13% of the alleles), one nonsense mutation (0.5% of the alleles), four small deletions with frame shift (6% of the alleles), one small insertion with frame shift (0.5% of the alleles), and two large deletions (2% of the alleles). the most frequent mutation was p.r408w in exon 12, representing 29% of the alleles, which is in concordance with other neighboring and/or slavic pku populations. other common mutations were: p.r158q, p.a403v, p.p281l and p.e390g, accounting for 9%, 7%, 7% and 7% of the alleles respectively. five novel mutations were detected: c.43_44insag, c.56_59+1delacagg, p.v45a, p.l62p and p.r157s. large deletion of exon 5 (ex5del955) was found in three patients and a deletion of exon 3 (ex3del4765) in one patient. a spectrum of 64 different genotypes was found, seven of them accounting for over than a third of all families. among thirteen families with homozygous mutation (13% of the pku population), 10 had p.r408w, two had p.r158q and one had p.e390g. among 107 families, 58 were classified as classic pku (54.2%), 28 as mild pku (25.9%) and 21 as mhp (19.6%). twenty-six different genotypes (40.6%) were predicted to be bh(4)-responsive, represented by 38 different families (35.5%).	-1
pharmacological characterization of 40 human melanocortin-4 receptor polymorphisms with the endogenous proopiomelanocortin-derived agonists and the agouti-related protein (agrp) antagonist.  the melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) is a g-protein coupled receptor (gpcr) that is expressed in the central nervous system and has a role in regulating energy homeostasis and obesity. up to a remarkable 6% of morbidly obese adults and children studied possess single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) of the mc4r. upon stimulation by agonist, the mc4r signals through the intracellular adenylate cyclase signal transduction pathway. posttranslational modification of the pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc) gene transcript results in the generation of several endogenous melanocortin receptor agonists including alpha-, beta-, gamma-melanocyte stimulating hormones (msh) and adrenocorticotropin (acth) ligands. the endogenous mc4r antagonist, agouti-related protein (agrp), is expressed in the brain and is only one of two naturally occurring antagonists of gpcrs identified to date. herein, we have generated 40 hmc4 polymorphic receptors and evaluated their cell surface expression by flow cytometry as well as pharmacologically characterized their functionality using the endogenous agonists alpha-msh, beta-msh, gamma2-msh, acth(1-24), the antagonist hagrp(87-132), and the synthetic agonists ndp-msh and mtii. this is the first study in which polymorphic hmc4rs have been pharmacologically characterized simultaneously with multiple endogenous ligands. interestingly, at the n97d, l106p, and c271y hmc4rs beta-msh was more potent than the other endogenous agonists alpha-msh, gamma2-msh, acth(1-24). the s58c and r165q/w hmc4rs possessed significantly reduced endogenous agonist potency (15- to 90-fold), but the synthetic ligands ndp-msh and mtii possessed only 2-9-fold reduced potency as compared to the wild-type receptor, suggesting their potential as therapeutic ligands to treat individuals with these polymorphisms.	1
rapid detection of genetic variants in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by custom dna resequencing array in clinical practice.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is the most common inherited cardiac disease (1/500) and the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young people. pathogenic mutation detection of hcm is having a growing impact on the medical management of patients and their families. however, the remarkable genetic and allelic heterogeneity makes molecular analysis by conventional methods very time-consuming, expensive and difficult to realise in a routine diagnostic molecular laboratory. the authors used their custom dna resequencing array which interrogates all possible single-nucleotide variants on both strands of all exons (n=160), splice sites and 5'-untranslated region of 12 hcm genes (27 000 nucleotides). the results for 122 unrelated patients with hcm are presented. thirty-three known or novel potentially pathogenic heterozygous single-nucleotide variants were identified in 38 patients (31%) in genes myh7, mybpc3, tnnt2, tnni3, tpm1, myl3 and actc1. although next-generation sequencing will replace all large-scale sequencing platforms for inherited cardiac disorders in the near future, this hcm resequencing array is currently the most rapid, cost-effective and reasonably efficient technology for first-tier mutation screening of hcm in clinical practice. because of its design, the array is also an appropriate tool for initial screening of other inherited forms of cardiomyopathy.	-1
novel compound heterozygous mutations in myo7a associated with usher syndrome 1 in a chinese family.  usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, age-dependent retinitis pigmentosa (rp), and occasionally vestibular dysfunction. the most severe form is usher syndrome type 1 (ush1). mutations in the myo7a gene are responsible for ush1 and account for 29-55% of ush1 cases. here, we characterized a chinese family (no. 7162) with ush1. combining the targeted capture of 131 known deafness genes, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis, we identified two deleterious compound heterozygous mutations in the myo7a gene: a reported missense mutation c.73g>a (p.g25r) and a novel nonsense mutation c.462c>a (p.c154x). the two compound variants are absent in 219 ethnicity-matched controls, co-segregates with the ush clinical phenotypes, including hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and age-dependent penetrance of progressive rp, in family 7162. therefore, we concluded that the ush1 in this family was caused by compound heterozygous mutations in myo7a.	-1
mutation in bag3 causes severe dominant childhood muscular dystrophy.  myofibrillar myopathies (mfms) are morphologically distinct but genetically heterogeneous muscular dystrophies in which disintegration of z disks and then of myofibrils is followed by ectopic accumulation of multiple proteins. cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and dominant inheritance are frequent associated features. mutations in alphab-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, zasp, or filamin-c can cause mfms and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the mayo mfm cohort. bag3, another z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality. we therefore searched for mutations in bag3 in 53 unrelated mfm patients. we searched for mutations in bag3 by direct sequencing. we analyzed structural changes in muscle by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, examined mobility of the mutant bag3 by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and searched for abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein in cos-7 (sv-40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast-7) cells. we identified a heterozygous p.pro209leu mutation in three patients. all presented in childhood, had progressive limb and axial muscle weakness, and experienced development of cardiomyopathy and severe respiratory insufficiency in their teens; two had rigid spines, and one a peripheral neuropathy. electron microscopy showed disintegration of z disks, extensive accumulation of granular debris and larger inclusions, and apoptosis of 8% of the nuclei. on nondenaturing electrophoresis of muscle extracts, the bag3 complex migrated faster in patient than control extracts, and expression of flag-labeled mutant and wild-type bag3 in cos cells showed abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein. we conclude mutation in bag3 defines a novel severe autosomal dominant childhood muscular dystrophy.	-1
homomeric and heteromeric assembly of kcnq (kv7) k+ channels assayed by total internal reflection fluorescence/fluorescence resonance energy transfer and patch clamp analysis.  m-type k(+) channels, consisting of kcnq1-5 (kv7.1-7.5) subunits, form a variety of homomeric and heteromeric channels. whereas all the subunits can assemble into homomeric channels, the ability of the subunits to assemble into heteromultimers is highly variable. kcnq3 is widely thought to co-assemble with several other kcnq subtypes, whereas kcnq1 and kcnq2 do not. however, the existence of other subunit assemblies is not well studied. to systematically explore the heteromeric assembly of kcnq channels in individual living cells, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) between cyan fluorescent protein- and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged kcnq subunits expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in which excitation light only penetrates several hundred nanometers into the cell, thus isolating membrane events. we found significant fret between homomeric subunits as expected from their functional expression in heterologous expression systems. also as expected from previous work, robust fret was observed between kcnq2 and kcnq3. kcnq3 and kcnq4 also showed substantial fret as did kcnq4 and kcnq5. to determine functional assembly of kcnq4/kcnq5 heteromers, we performed two types of experiments. in the first, we constructed a mutant tetraethylammonium ion-sensitive kcnq4 subunit and tested its assembly with kcnq5 by patch clamp analysis of the tetraethylammonium ion sensitivity of the resulting current; however, those data were not conclusive. in the second, we co-expressed a kcnq4 (g285s) pore mutant with kcnq5 and found the former to act as a dominant negative, suggesting co-assembly of the two types of subunits. these data confirm that among the allowed assembly conformations are kcnq3/4 and kcnq4/5 heteromers.	1
"the distribution and characteristics of ldl receptor mutations in china: a systematic review.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a common and serious dominant genetic disease, and its main pathogenic gene is the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene. this study aimed to perform a systematic review of ldlr mutations in china. using pubmed, embase, wanfang (chinese), the chinese national knowledge infrastructure (chinese), and the chinese biological and medical database (chinese), public data were limited to december 2014. the medical subject headings terms and the following key words were used: ""familial hypercholesterolemia"", ""chinese"", ""china"", ""hong kong"", and ""taiwan"". a total of 74 studies including 295 probands with 131 ldlr mutations were identified. most of the mutations were located in exon 4 of ldlr and approximately 60% of the mutations were missense mutations. thirty new mutations that were not recorded in the ldlr databases were found. in silico analysis revealed that most of the mutations were pathogenic. the primary ldlr mutations were c308y, h562y, and a606t, and all of the mutations had functional significance. prevalence data suggest that there are nearly 3.8 million fh patients in china, although reported numbers are much smaller, suggesting that fh is widely misunderstood. this systematic review provides information that is specific to china for inclusion in the international fh database."	1
late-onset pompe disease in iran: a clinical and genetic report.  pompe disease is characterized by absence or deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase, and several causative mutations are known. in this study we report clinical and laboratory data in iranian patients with late-onset pompe disease (lopd), focusing on population-specific mutations. clinical and laboratory data of 14 patients from 10 families with the diagnosis of lopd were recorded. all had reduced enzyme activity on dried blood spot (dbs) analysis. genetic investigation was performed to identify the underlying mutations. the age of onset ranged from <2 to 38 years. the clinical presentations were heterogeneous. two siblings presented with foot drop. the most common mutation was c.(-32-13t>g). there were 4 novel mutations: c.(2040 + 2dup); c.(1650delg); c.(1837t>g); and c.(2596delg). this is a comprehensive report of lopd in iranian patients. distinct phenotypic and genotypic features in this population are highlighted. muscle nerve 55: 835-840, 2017.	-1

variability in the ratio of mutant to wildtype myosin heavy chain present in the soleus muscle of patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. a new approach for the quantification of mutant to wildtype protein.  the ratio of mutant to wildtype myosin heavy chain (beta-isoform, beta-mhc) in the soleus muscle of patients with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was determined by a combination of hplc, mass spectrometry and capillary zone electrophoresis. in two patients, one with a val 606 met mutation and another with a gly 584 arg mutation, the fraction of mutant beta-mhc was only 12+/-6% and 23+/-0.7% of total beta-mhc, respectively. these results demonstrate the necessity to determine the ratio of mutant to wildtype protein for the interpretation of functional studies on biopsy material from heterozygous patients with an inherited disease.	-1
phenylalanine hydroxylase gene mutations in the united states: report from the maternal pku collaborative study.  the major cause of hyperphenylalaninemia is mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). the known mutations have been identified primarily in european patients. the purpose of this study was to determine the spectrum of mutations responsible for pah deficiency in the united states. one hundred forty-nine patients enrolled in the maternal pku collaborative study were subjects for clinical and molecular investigations. pah gene mutations associated with phenylketonuria (pku) or mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mhp) were identified on 279 of 294 independent mutant chromosomes, a diagnostic efficiency of 95%. the spectrum is composed of 71 different mutations, including 47 missense mutations, 11 splice mutations, 5 nonsense mutations, and 8 microdeletions. sixteen previously unreported mutations were identified. among the novel mutations, five were found in patients with mhp, and the remainder were found in patients with pku. the most common mutations were r408w, ivs12nt1g-->a, and y414c, accounting for 18.7%, 7.8%, and 5.4% of the mutant chromosomes, respectively. thirteen mutations had relative frequencies of 1%-5%, and 55 mutations each had frequencies < or = 1%. the mutational spectrum corresponded to that observed for the european ancestry of the u.s. population. to evaluate the extent of allelic variation at the pah locus within the united states in comparison with other populations, we used allele frequencies to calculate the homozygosity for 11 populations where >90% ascertainment of mutations has been obtained. the united states was shown to contain one of the most heterogeneous populations, with homozygosity values similar to sicily and ethnically mixed sample populations in europe. the extent of allelic heterogeneity must be a major determining factor in the choice of mutation-detection methodology for molecular diagnosis in pah deficiency.	-1
assessment of diastolic function with doppler tissue imaging to predict genotype in preclinical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) is considered diagnostic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) but fails to identify all genetically affected individuals. altered diastolic function has been hypothesized to represent an earlier manifestation of hcm before the development of lvh; however, data regarding the clinical utility of imaging techniques that assess this parameter are limited. echocardiographic studies including doppler tissue imaging (dti) were performed in a genotyped hcm population with beta-myosin heavy chain (beta -mhc) mutations. genotype (+) individuals with lvh (g+/lvh+; n=18) and genotype (+) individuals without lvh (g+/lvh-; n=18) were compared with normal control subjects (n=36). left ventricular ejection fraction (ef) was significantly higher in both genotype (+) groups (75+/-5% and 71+/-6%, respectively, versus 64+/- 5% in control subjects; p<0.0001). mean early diastolic myocardial velocities (ea) were significantly lower in both genotype (+) subgroups, irrespective of lvh (p<0.02). however, there was substantial overlap in ea velocities between the g+/lvh- and control groups. an ea velocity of < or =13.5 cm/s had 86% specificity and 75% sensitivity for identifying genotype-positive subjects. the combination of ef > or =68% and ea velocity <15 cm/s was 100% specific and 44% sensitive in predicting affected genotype. abnormalities of diastolic function assessed by doppler tissue imaging precede the development of lvh in individuals with hcm caused by beta -mhc mutations. although ea velocity alone was not sufficiently sensitive as a sole diagnostic criterion, the combination of ea velocity and ef was highly predictive of affected genotype in individuals without overt manifestations of hcm.	-1
clinical features of patients with gjb2 (connexin 26) mutations: severity of hearing loss is correlated with genotypes and protein expression patterns.  mutations in the gjb2 (connexin 26, cx26) gene are the major cause of nonsyndromic hearing impairment in many populations. genetic testing offers opportunities to determine the cause of deafness and predict the course of hearing, enabling the prognostication of language development. in the current study, we compared severity of hearing impairment in 60 patients associated with biallelic gjb2 mutations and assessed the correlation of genotypes and phenotypes. within a spectrum of gjb2 mutations found in the japanese population, the phenotype of the most prevalent mutation, 235delc, was found to show more severe hearing impairment than that of v37i, which is the second most frequent mutation. the results of the present study, taken together with phenotypes caused by other types of mutations, support the general rule that phenotypes caused by the truncating gjb2 mutations are more severe than those caused by missense mutations. the present in vitro study further confirmed that differences in phenotypes could be explained by the protein expression pattern.	-1
pku mutation (d143g) associated with an apparent high residual enzyme activity: expression of a kinetic variant form of phenylalanine hydroxylase in three different systems.  we have used three complementary in vitro systems to express the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene at high levels. recombinant pah was expressed in escherichia coli (as a fusion protein), in human kidney cells and in a cell-free in vitro transcription-translation system. these systems were used to characterize a novel kinetic variant form (d143g) of the enzyme. the recombinant d143g mutant enzyme had the same physicochemical properties as the wild-type pah and was stable when expressed in eukaryotic cells. enzyme activity studies of the d143g mutant enzyme, produced in the three expression systems, revealed a kinetic variant form with reduced affinity for l-phe (about 2.4-fold increase in the s0.5 value) as well as reduced affinity for tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) (about 2-fold increase in the apparent km). at standard assay conditions (1 mm l-phe, t5 microm bh4) the residual activity of the mutant enzyme was high and variable (52%, 33%, and 102%) when analysed in the three different systems. the high residual activities of the mutant enzyme obtained at these conditions were not in agreement with the classical pku phenotype found in a patient compound heterozygous for the termination mutation g272x and the novel d143g mutation. however, when the d143g mutant enzyme was assayed at lower concentrations of l-phe (100-300 microm) and bh4 (10 microm) the residual activities were compatible with severely reduced hydroxylation of l-phe and the classical pku phenotype.	1
diversity and functional consequences of germline and somatic ptpn11 mutations in human disease.  germline mutations in ptpn11, the gene encoding the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp-2, cause noonan syndrome (ns) and the clinically related leopard syndrome (ls), whereas somatic mutations in the same gene contribute to leukemogenesis. on the basis of our previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we proposed a model that splits ns- and leukemia-associated ptpn11 mutations into two major classes of activating lesions with differential perturbing effects on development and hematopoiesis. to test this model, we investigated further the diversity of germline and somatic ptpn11 mutations, delineated the association of those mutations with disease, characterized biochemically a panel of mutant shp-2 proteins recurring in ns, ls, and leukemia, and performed molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutations. our results document a strict correlation between the identity of the lesion and disease and demonstrate that ns-causative mutations have less potency for promoting shp-2 gain of function than do leukemia-associated ones. furthermore, we show that the recurrent ls-causing y279c and t468m amino acid substitutions engender loss of shp-2 catalytic activity, identifying a previously unrecognized behavior for this class of missense ptpn11 mutations.	1
biochemical characterization of novel germline braf and mek mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome.  cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (cfc) is a sporadic, complex developmental disorder involving characteristic craniofacial features, cardiac defects, ectodermal abnormalities, growth deficiency, hypotonia, and developmental delay. cfc is caused by alteration of activity through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway due to heterogeneous de novo germline mutations in b-raf mutant proteins, mek1 and mek2. approximately 75% of individuals with cfc have mutations in braf. in vitro functional studies demonstrate that many of these mutations confer increase activity upon the mutant protein as compared to the wildtype protein. however, as is seen cancer, some of the b-raf mutant proteins are kinase impaired. western blot analyses corroborate kinase assays as determined by mutant proteins phosphorylating downstream effectors mek and erk. approximately 25% of individuals with cfc have mutations in either mek1 or mek2 that lead to increased mek kinase activity as judged by increased phosphorylation of its downstream effector erk. unlike braf, no somatic mutations have ever been identified in mek genes. the identification of novel germline braf and mek mutations in cfc will help understand the pathophysiology of this syndrome. furthermore, it will also provide insight to the normal function of b-raf and mek, and contribute to the knowledge of the role of the mapk pathway in cancer. since the mapk pathway has been studied intensively in the context of cancer, numerous therapeutics that specifically target this pathway may merit investigation in this population of patients.	1
characterization of p53 oligomerization domain mutations isolated from li-fraumeni and li-fraumeni like family members.  p53 is a tumour suppressor gene which functions as a transcription factor to upregulate genes for growth arrest and apoptosis following dna damage. p53 mutations are associated with li-fraumeni and li-fraumeni like syndromes. recently mutations of the oligomerization domain have been isolated from an lfs and an lfl family affecting respectively codon 344 (leu to pro) and 337 (arg to cys). the present study was designed to determine the affect of these mutations on the function of p53 protein. p53 344 leu to pro existed only in a monomeric form and could not bind to dna. it was inactive at inducing apoptosis, transactivating luciferase from a bax promoter and inhibiting cell growth. in contrast, p53 337 arg to cys could form tetramers and could bind to dna. however, p53 337 arg to cys was not fully active and could only induce apoptosis, transactivate luciferase from a bax promoter and inhibit cell growth with approximately 60% of the ability of wild-type p53. both mutant proteins had reduced ability to bind to mdm2, p53 337 arg to cys being more reduced than p53 344 leu to pro. these results indicate that point mutations in the oligomerization domain can disrupt p53 function. in addition, the value of lfs and lfl families for the further understanding of the biological and biochemical properties of p53 is demonstrated.	1
uptake of cardiac screening and genetic testing among hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy families.  cardiomyopathy is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous, life threatening disease which affects people of all ages. recent guidelines provide recommendations for cardiac screening and genetic testing in at-risk relatives, but the uptake and impact of these measures in the united states is unknown. this is a single institution retrospective study that characterizes the uptake of cardiac screening and genetic testing for relatives of a cohort of 57 probands with hypertrophic (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) who underwent both clinical evaluation and genetic testing. cardiac screening was indicated for 302 relatives. one hundred and seventy-three (57 %) completed cardiac screening. forty of the 57 probands were mutation positive and genetic testing was indicated for 213 relatives. eighty-four (39 %) completed genetic testing. the uptake of cardiac surveillance was greater than the uptake of genetic testing (p < 0.0001) among relatives of mutation positive probands. within the group of at-risk, asymptomatic relatives of probands, cardiac screening and genetic testing were positive in 25 % and 40 % of cases, respectively. these data demonstrate the important role and utility of cascade cardiac screening and genetic testing in the care of patients and families with hcm or dcm. the approach to cardiac screening and genetic testing should be family-specific and requires expertise in the genetics of cardiomyopathy.	-1
response of 33 uk patients with infantile-onset pompe disease to enzyme replacement therapy.  enzyme replacement therapy (ert) for infantile-onset pompe disease has been commercially available for almost 10 years. we report the experience of its use in a cohort treated at three specialist lysosomal treatment centres in the uk. a retrospective case-note review was performed, with additional data being gathered from two national audits on all such patients treated with ert. the impact on the outcome of various characteristics, measured just prior to the initiation of ert (baseline), was evaluated using logistic regression. thirty-three patients were identified; 13/29 (45%) were cross-reactive immunological material (crim) negative, and nine were immunomodulated. at baseline assessment, 79% were in heart failure, 66% had failure to thrive and 70% had radiological signs of focal pulmonary collapse. the overall survival rate was 60%, ventilation-free survival was 40% and 30% of patients were ambulatory. median follow-up of survivors was 4 years, 1.5 months (range 6 months to 13.5 years). as with previous studies, the crim status impacted on all outcome measures. however, in this cohort, baseline failure to thrive was related to death and lack of ambulation, and left ventricular dilatation was a risk factor for non-ventilator-free survival. the outcome of treated patients remains heterogeneous despite attempts at immunomodulation. failure to thrive at baseline and left ventricular dilation appear to be associated with poorer outcomes.	-1
rapid mutation screening of phenylketonuria by polymerase chain reaction-linked restriction enzyme assay and direct sequence of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene: clinical application in northern japan and northern china.  we describe a simple and technically feasible method for mutation screening of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene and its application to japanese and chinese patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. the strategy is based on the identification of a nucleotide substitution by restriction enzyme analysis, coupled with pcr and direct sequencing of exon 7 of the pah gene. because the detection of various mutations can proceed simultaneously using the same technique, it is quite rapid and reproducible, making it possible to perform effective molecular diagnosis and carrier screening in most laboratories. using this procedure, we found that the most common molecular defects were r413p in hokkaido, japan (35 %) and r243q in heilongjiang, china (50%). r111x, ivs4nt-1, and five mutations in exon 7 (r241c, r243q, r252w, a259t, and s273p) accounted for 55% of phenylketonuria (pku) alleles in hokkaido. in heilongjiang, the r111x, y356x, and r408w mutations accounted for 35% of pku alleles. clinically, homozygotes or compound heterozygotes of null alleles, which express nonfunctional enzyme activity, were all associated with classic pku. on the other hand, patients heterozygous for the r241c allele had a benign phenotype of mild hyperphenylalaninemia. the dna diagnosis in early infancy can predict various pku phenotypes, and can prove useful in decision-making concerning dietary therapy.	-1
biopterin responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. there have been more than 400 mutations identified in the pah gene leading to variable degrees of deficiency in pah activity, and consequently a wide spectrum of clinical severity. a pilot study was undertaken to examine the response to 6-r-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) in patients with atypical and classical pku. pah gene mutation analysis was performed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and gene sequencing. patients with classical, atypical, or mild pku were orally given bh4 10 mg/kg. blood phenylalanine and tyrosine levels were determined using tandem ms/ms at 0 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and 24 hours intervals. thirty-six patients were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg of bh4. twenty one patients (58.33%) responded with a decrease in blood phenylalanine level. of the patients that responded, 12 were classical, 7 atypical, and 2 mild. the mean decline in blood phenylalanine at 24 hours was > 30% of baseline. there were 15 patients who did not respond to the bh4 challenge, 14 of those had classical and one had atypical pku. mapping the mutations that responded to bh4 on the pah enzyme showed that mutations were in the catalytic, regulatory, oligomerization, and bh4 binding domains. five patients responding to bh4 had mutations not previously identified. the data presented suggest higher than anticipated number of pku mutations respond to bh4, and such mutations are on all the domains of pah.	-1
bone marrow pathologic abnormalities in familial platelet disorder with propensity for myeloid malignancy and germline runx1 mutation.  a subset of patients with familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy and germline runx1 mutation develops hematological malignancies, often myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, currently recognized in the 2016 who classification. patients who develop hematologic malignancies are typically young, respond poorly to conventional therapy, and need allogeneic stem cell transplant from non-familial donors. understanding the spectrum of bone marrow morphologic and genetic findings in these patients is critical to ensure diagnostic accuracy and develop criteria to recognize the onset of hematologic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic syndrome. however, bone marrow features remain poorly characterized. to address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the clinicopathologic and genetic findings of 11 patients from 7 pedigrees. of these, 6 patients did not develop hematologic malignancies over a 22-month follow-up period; 5 patients developed hematologic malignancies (3 acute myeloid leukemia; 2 myelodysplastic syndrome). all patients had thrombocytopenia at initial presentation. all 6 patients who did not develop hematologic malignancies showed baseline bone marrow abnormalities: low-for-age cellularity (n=4), dysmegakaryopoiesis (n=5), megakaryocytic hypoplasia/hyperplasia (n=5), and eosinophilia (n=4). two patients had multiple immunophenotypic alterations in cd34-positive myeloblasts; 1 patient had clonal hematopoiesis. in contrast, patients who developed hematologic malignancies had additional cytopenia(s) (n=4), abnormal platelet granulation (n=5), bone marrow hypercellularity (n=4), dysplasia in ?2 lineages including megakaryocytes (n=3) and acquired clonal genetic aberrations (n=5). in conclusion, our study demonstrated that specific bone marrow abnormalities and acquired genetic alterations may be harbingers of progression to hematological malignancies in patients with familial platelet disorder with germlinerunx1 mutation.	-1
younger age of cancer initiation is associated with shorter telomere length in li-fraumeni syndrome.  li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is a cancer predisposition syndrome frequently associated with germ line tp53 mutations. unpredictable and disparate age of cancer onset is a major challenge in the management of lfs. genetic modifiers, including the mdm2-snp309 polymorphism, and genetic anticipation have been suggested as plausible explanations for young age of tumor onset, but the molecular mechanisms for these observations are unknown. we speculated that telomere attrition will increase genomic instability and cause earlier tumor onset in successive generations. we analyzed mean telomere length and mdm2-snp309 polymorphism status in individuals from multiple lfs families and controls. a total of 45 peripheral blood lymphocyte samples were analyzed from 9 lfs families and 15 controls. high rate of mdm2-snp309 was found in tp53 carriers (p = 0.0003). in children, telomere length was shorter in carriers affected with cancer than in nonaffected carriers and wild-type controls (p < 0.0001). the same pattern was seen in adults (p = 0.002). within each family, telomere length was shorter in children with cancer than in their nonaffected siblings and their noncarrier parents. telomere attrition between children and adults was faster in carriers than in controls. our results support the role of mdm2-snp309 as a genetic modifier in lfs. the novel finding of accelerated telomere attrition in lfs suggests that telomere length could explain earlier age of onset in successive generations of the same family with identical tp53/mdm2-snp309 genotypes. furthermore, telomere shortening could predict genetic anticipation observed in lfs and may serve as the first rational biological marker for clinical monitoring of these patients.	-1
phenylketonuria mutation analysis in northern ireland: a rapid stepwise approach.  we present a multistep approach for the rapid analysis of phenylketonuria (pku) mutations. in the first step, three common mutations and a polymorphic short tandem repeat (str) system are rapidly analyzed with a fluorescent multiplex assay. in the second step, minihaplotypes combining str and vntr data are used to determine rare mutations likely to be present in an investigated patient, which are then confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. the remaining mutations are analyzed with denaturant gradient-gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the first two steps together identify both mutations in 90%-95% of pku patients, and results can be obtained within 2 d. we have investigated 121 northern irish families with hyperphenylalaninemia, including virtually all patients born since 1972, and have found 34 different mutations on 241 of the 242 mutant alleles. three mutations (r408w, i65t, and f39l) account for 57.5% of mutations, while 14 mutations occur with a frequency of 1%-6%. the present analysis system is efficient and inexpensive and is particularly well suited to routine mutation analysis in a diagnostic setting.	-1
identification and molecular modelling of a mutation in the motor head domain of myosin viia in a family with autosomal dominant hearing impairment (dfna11).  myosin viia is an unconventional myosin that has been implicated in usher syndrome type 1b, atypical usher syndrome, non-syndromic autosomal recessive hearing impairment (dfnb2) and autosomal dominant hearing impairment (dfna11). here, we present a family with non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing impairment that clinically resembles the previously published dfna11 family. the affected family members show a flat audiogram at young ages and only modest progression, most clearly at the high frequencies. in addition, they suffer from minor vestibular symptoms. linkage analysis yielded a maximum two-point lodscore of 3.43 for marker d11s937 located within 1 cm of the myosin viia gene. the myosin viia gene was sequenced and 11 nucleotide variations were found. ten nucleotide changes represent benign intronic variants, silent exon mutations or non-pathologic amino acid substitutions. one variant, a c.1373a-->t transversion that is heterozygously present in all affected family members and absent in 300 healthy individuals, is predicted to result in an asn458ile amino acid substitution. asn458 is located in a region of the myosin viia motor domain that is highly conserved in different classes of myosins and in myosins of different species. to evaluate whether the asn458ile mutation was indeed responsible for the hearing impairment, a molecular model of myosin viia was built based on the known structure of the myosin ii heavy chain from dictyostelium discoideum. in this model, conformational changes in the protein caused by the amino acid substitution asn458ile are predicted to disrupt atp/adp binding and impair the myosin power-stroke, which would have a severe effect on the function of the myosin viia protein.	-1
pten autoregulates its expression by stabilization of p53 in a phosphatase-independent manner.  pten (phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10) is a tumor suppressor with dual phosphatase activity and mutations of its gene, pten, have been associated with many sporadic cancers and heritable neoplasia syndromes, including cowden syndrome and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome. however, accumulating evidence now shows that pten may have novel functions other than as a phosphatase. in the present study, we show that pten is able to autoregulate its expression through the stabilization of another tumor suppressor p53. we further show that pten enhances p53 transactivation, a relationship that requires the interaction between pten and p53 and is pten phosphatase independent. we show that cell lines from cowden syndrome and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome patients with germ line pten promoter mutations in the vicinity of the p53-binding motifs have altered p53 regulation. this seems to be due to reduced pten stability and decreased pten-p53 interactions. our data provide clues to better understand the regulation of pten expression and the possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of the subset of cowden syndrome individuals with germ line promoter variation and who lack mutations in the pten coding region and splice sites. importantly, this mechanism also holds for those sporadic tumors that lack intragenic mutations but have hemizygous deletion of pten, which includes the promoter region as manifested by loss-of-heterozygosity of 10q markers. the importance of our observations is underlined by the broad spectrum of neoplasias that harbor somatic pten or p53 alterations, or both.	1
a short guide to hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is the only known predisposition syndrome dominated by carcinoma of the stomach and with a recognised genetic cause. germline mutations in the e-cadherin gene (cdh1) co-segregate with the disease in about half of the families with multiple diffuse gastric cancer. in these families, identification of the cdh1 mutation allows for clinical measures to be taken. importantly, clinical intervention is likely to be therapeutic and associated with tolerable morbidity. this review is thus aimed at providing a current overview of the clinical management and the underlying biology of hdgc.	-1
biochemical and imaging surveillance in germline tp53 mutation carriers with li-fraumeni syndrome: 11 year follow-up of a prospective observational study.  carriers of a germline tp53 pathogenic variant have a substantial lifetime risk of developing cancer. in 2011, we did a prospective observational study of members of families who chose to either undergo a comprehensive surveillance protocol for individuals with li-fraumeni syndrome or not. we sought to update our assessment of and modify the surveillance protocol, so in this study we report both longer follow-up of these patients and additional patients who underwent surveillance, as well as update the originally presented surveillance protocol. a clinical surveillance protocol using physical examination and frequent biochemical and imaging studies (consisting of whole-body mri, brain mri, breast mri, mammography, abdominal and pelvic ultrasound, and colonoscopy) was introduced at three tertiary care centres in canada and the usa on jan 1, 2004, for carriers of tp53 pathogenic variants. after confirmation of tp53 mutation, participants either chose to undergo surveillance or chose not to undergo surveillance. patients could cross over between groups at any time. the primary outcome measure was detection of asymptomatic tumours by surveillance investigations. the secondary outcome measure was 5 year overall survival established from a tumour diagnosed symptomatically (in the non-surveillance group) versus one diagnosed by surveillance. we completed survival analyses using an as-treated approach. between jan 1, 2004, and july 1, 2015, we identified 89 carriers of tp53 pathogenic variants in 39 unrelated families, of whom 40 (45%) agreed to surveillance and 49 (55%) declined surveillance. 19 (21%) patients crossed over from the non-surveillance to the surveillance group, giving a total of 59 (66%) individuals undergoing surveillance for a median of 32 months (iqr 12-87). 40 asymptomatic tumours have been detected in 19 (32%) of 59 patients who underwent surveillance. two additional cancers were diagnosed between surveillance assessments (false negatives) and two biopsied lesions were non-neoplastic entities on pathological review (false positives). among the 49 individuals who initially declined surveillance, 61 symptomatic tumours were diagnosed in 43 (88%) patients. 21 (49%) of the 43 individuals not on surveillance who developed cancer were alive compared with 16 (84%) of the 19 individuals undergoing surveillance who developed cancer (p=0012) after a median follow-up of 46 months (iqr 22-72) for those not on surveillance and 38 months (12-86) for those on surveillance. 5 year overall survival was 888% (95% ci 787-100) in the surveillance group and 596% (472-752) in the non-surveillance group (p=00132). our findings show that long-term compliance with a comprehensive surveillance protocol for early tumour detection in individuals with pathogenic tp53 variants is feasible and that early tumour detection through surveillance is associated with improved long-term survival. incorporation of this approach into clinical management of these patients should be considered. canadian institutes for heath research, canadian cancer society, terry fox research institute, sickkids foundation, and soccer for hope foundation.	-1
identification of pathogenic mechanisms of coch mutations, abolished cochlin secretion, and intracellular aggregate formation: genotype-phenotype correlations in dfna9 deafness and vestibular disorder.  mutations in coch (coagulation factor c homology) cause autosomal-dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss with variable degrees of clinical onset and vestibular malfunction. we selected eight uncharacterized mutations and performed immunocytochemical and western blot analyses to track cochlin through the secretory pathway. we then performed a comprehensive analysis of clinical information from dfna9 patients with all 21 known coch mutations in conjunction with cellular and molecular findings to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. our studies revealed that five mutants were not secreted into the media: two von willebrand factor a (vwfa) domain mutants, which were not transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to golgi complex and formed high-molecular-weight aggregates in cell lysates, and three lccl domain mutants, which were detected as intracellular dimeric cochlins. mutant cochlins that were not secreted and accumulated in cells result in earlier age of onset of hearing defects. in addition, individuals with lccl domain mutations show accompanying vestibular dysfunction, whereas those with vwfa domain mutations exhibit predominantly hearing loss. this is the first report showing failure of mutant cochlin transport through the secretory pathway, abolishment of cochlin secretion, and formation and retention of dimers and large multimeric intracellular aggregates, and high correlation with earlier onset and progression of hearing loss in individuals with these dfna9-causing mutations.	1
effect of enzyme therapy in juvenile patients with pompe disease: a three-year open-label study.  pompe disease is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase. treatment with recombinant human ?-glucosidase recently received marketing approval based on prolonged survival of affected infants. the current open-label study was performed to evaluate the response in older children (age 5.9-15.2 years). the five patients that we studied had limb-girdle muscle weakness and three of them also had decreased pulmonary function in upright and supine position. they received 20-mg/kg recombinant human ?-glucosidase every two weeks over a 3-year period. no infusion-associated reactions were observed. pulmonary function remained stable (n = 4) or improved slightly (n = 1). muscle strength increased. only one patient approached the normal range. patients obtained higher scores on the quick motor function test. none of the patients deteriorated. follow-up data of two unmatched historical cohorts of adults and children with pompe disease were used for comparison. they showed an average decline in pulmonary function of 1.6% and 5% per year. data on muscle strength and function of untreated children were not available. further studies are required.	-1
diagnostic dilemmas in fabry disease: a case series study on gla mutations of unknown clinical significance.  fabry disease' (fd) phenotype is heterogeneous: alpha-galactosidase a gene mutations (gla) can lead to classical or non-classical fd, or no fd. the aim of this study is to describe pitfalls in diagnosing non-classical fd and assess the diagnostic value of plasma globotriaosylsphingosine. this is a case series study. family 1 (p.a143t) presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), absent classical fd signs, high residual alpha-galactosidase a activity (agal-a) and normal plasma globotriaosylsphingosine. co-segregating sarcomeric mutations were found. cardiac biopsy excluded fd. in family 2 (p.p60l), fd was suspected after kidney biopsy in a female with chloroquine use. males had residual agal-a, no classical fd signs and minimally increased plasma globotriaosylsphingosine, indicating that p.p60l is most likely non-pathogenic. non-specific complications and histology can be explained by chloroquine and alternative causes. males of two unrelated families (p.r112h) show agal-a <5%, but slightly elevated plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (1.2-2.0 classical males >50 nmol/l). histological evidence suggests a variable penetrance of this mutation. patients with gla mutations and non-specific findings such as hcm may have non-classical fd or no fd. other (genetic) causes of fd-like findings should be excluded, including medication inducing fd-like storage. plasma globotriaosylsphingosine may serve as a diagnostic tool, but histology of an affected organ is often mandatory.	1
somatic mutations in <i>cdh1</i> and <i>ctnnb1</i> in primary carcinomas at 13 anatomic sites.  metastases are involved in most cancer deaths. evidence has suggested that cancer cell detachment from primary tumors might occur largely via the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) activated by epigenetic events, but data addressing other possible triggers of detachment, particularly genetic mutations, have been limited. using the profile study of cancer genomics at dana-farber cancer institute, we examined somatic mutations in the emt genes <i>cdh1</i> in 5,106 primary carcinomas and <i>ctnnb1</i> in 7,578 primary carcinomas across 13 anatomic sites: urinary bladder, breast, colon/rectum, endometrium, esophagus, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin (non-melanoma), stomach, and thyroid. for each gene and anatomic site, we calculated the prevalence of primary carcinomas with at least one mutation. across all anatomic sites, 4% of carcinomas had at least one <i>cdh1</i> mutation and 4% of carcinomas had at least one <i>ctnnb1</i> mutation. by anatomic site, the observed prevalence of carcinomas with at least one mutation was less than 5% at 10 sites for <i>cdh1</i> and 12 sites for <i>ctnnb1</i>. tumor stage data were available for a subset of breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate tumors. among patients from this subset who were diagnosed with regional or distant disease, only 4% had a <i>cdh1</i> mutation and 1% had a <i>ctnnb1</i> mutation in the primary tumor. the low mutation prevalences, especially among those with diagnoses of regional or distant disease, suggest that somatic mutations in <i>cdh1</i> and <i>ctnnb1</i> are unlikely to explain a substantial proportion of cancer cell detachment from primary carcinomas originating at most anatomic sites.	-1
genetic heterozygosity and pseudodeficiency in the pompe disease newborn screening pilot program.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (lsd) caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) activity. this is the first lsd in which newborn screening has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. newborn screening also identified multiple rare gene variants in this population. among 132,538 newborns screened, 107 babies (1 in 1239) who had low dried blood spot gaa activity were genotyped. sixty-nine (64.5%) babies had a total of 54 mutations and 35 novel predictably pathogenic mutations; 36 babies (33.6%) who had no mutation were homozygous for the c.[1726a; 2065a] pseudodeficiency allele. because 81% of the chromosomes (14% in the controls) were in haplotype *03, we found a link between the pseudodeficiency allele and other mutated alleles. the newborns with pompe disease detected by screening had lymphocyte gaa activities 0.45 to 1.65 nmol/mg/h (normal 66.7+/-33.8), while only 2 of the 100 false-positive cases had gaa activity less than 2.00 nmol/mg/h (or 3% of the normal mean). therefore, newborn screening for pompe disease could be successfully conducted by including genotyping and lymphocyte gaa assay, even in a population with mutation heterozygosity and pseudodeficiency.	-1
juvenile and adult-onset acid maltase deficiency in france: genotype-phenotype correlation.  to characterize the phenotypes of patients with juvenile and adult-onset acid maltase deficiency (amd) in the french population and correlate them with genetic defects. amd is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the absence of the enzyme acid a-glucosidase (gaa). patients are generally compound heterozygotes for various mutations in the gaa gene. the most common mutant allele is a -13t to g transversion in intron 1. the authors performed a clinical, biochemical, and genetic study on 21 unrelated patients with juvenile and adult-onset amd. although onset of progressive muscle weakness occurred during adulthood in all cases but one, presence of mild, nonprogressive muscular symptoms appearing during childhood was detected in 16 patients. eighteen patients had a similar clinical pattern with pelvic girdle muscle weakness predominating in glutei and thigh adductors. restrictive respiratory insufficiency with vital capacity less than 60% was noted in eight patients, and respiratory failure was the first manifestation in two cases. all patients but one were compound heterozygotes, and 17 carried the ivs1 (-13t ---> g) transversion (one patient was homozygous for this mutation). the two mutated alleles were identified in 10 cases, with 13 different mutations detected in the gaa gene. there was no clear correlation between the type of mutation and phenotype. this study shows a high genetic heterogeneity of juvenile and adult amd in the french population. the absence of genotype-phenotype correlation suggests a complex physiopathology that requires further investigations.	-1
genotype-phenotype associations in french patients with phenylketonuria and importance of genotype for full assessment of tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness.  mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene cause phenylketonuria. sapropterin (bh4), the enzyme cofactor, is an important therapeutical strategy in phenylketonuria. however, pah is a highly polymorphic gene and it is difficult to identify bh4-responsive genotypes. we seek here to improve prediction of bh4-responsiveness through comparison of genotypes, bh4-loading test, predictions of responsiveness according to the literature and types and locations of mutations. a total of 364 french patients among which, 9 % had mild hyperphenylalaninemia, 17.7 % mild phenylketonuria and 73.1 % classical phenylketonuria, benefited from a 24-hour bh4-loading test and had the pah gene sequenced and analyzed by multiplex ligation probe amplification. overall, 31.6 % of patients were bh4-responsive. the number of different mutations found was 127, including 26 new mutations. the mutations c.434a > t, c.500a > t, c.529g > c, c.1045 t > g and c.1196 t > c were newly classified as being bh4-responsive. we identified 261 genotypes, among which 46 were newly recognized as being bh4-responsive. even though patients carry 2 responsive alleles, bh4-responsiveness cannot be predicted with certainty unless they present mild hyperphenylalaninemia. bh4-responsiveness cannot be predicted in patients carrying one responsive mutation only. in general, the milder the phenotype is, the stronger the bh4-response is. almost exclusively missense mutations, particularly in exons 12, 11 and 8, are associated with bh4-responsiveness and any other type of mutation predicts a negative response. this study is the first of its kind, in a french population, to identify the phenotype associated with several combinations of pah mutations. as others, it highlights the necessity of performing simultaneously bh4 loading test and molecular analysis in monitoring phenylketonuria patients.	-1
male breast cancer in cowden syndrome patients with germline pten mutations.  cowden syndrome (cs) (omim 158350) is a multiple hamartoma syndrome associated with germline mutations in the pten tumour suppressor gene. while cs is characterised most commonly by non-cancerous lesions (mucocutaneous trichilemmomas, acral and palmoplantar keratoses, and papillomatous papules), it is also associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer (in females) and thyroid cancer, as well as non-cancerous conditions of the breast and thyroid. here we report two cases of male breast cancer occurring in patients with classical cs phenotypes and germline pten mutations. the first subject was diagnosed with cs indicated primarily by mucocutaneous papillomatosis, facial trichilemmomas, and macrocephaly with frontal bossing at the age of 31 years. he developed breast cancer at 41 years and subsequently died of the disease. a pten mutation, c.802delg, was identified in this subject, yet none of his family members showed evidence of a cs phenotype, suggesting that this pten mutation may be a de novo occurrence. the second subject had a cs phenotype including multiple trichilemmomas and thyroid adenoma, developed male breast cancer at 43 years, and died of the disease at 57 years. he was a carrier of a pten mutation c.347-351delacaat that cosegregated with the cs phenotype in affected family members. these two cases of male breast cancer associated with germline pten mutations and the cs phenotype suggest that cs may be associated with an increased risk of early onset male as well as female breast cancer.	-1
new abcc8 mutations in relapsing neonatal diabetes and clinical features.  activating mutations in the abcc8 gene that encodes the sulfonylurea receptor 1 (sur1) regulatory subunit of the pancreatic islet atp-sensitive k(+) channel (k(atp) channel) cause both permanent and transient neonatal diabetes. recently, we have described the novel mechanism where basal mg-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of sur1 on the kir6.2 pore is increased. in our present study, we identified six new heterozygous abcc8 mutations, mainly in patients presenting the transient form of neonatal diabetes (six of eight), with a median duration of initial insulin therapy of 17 months (range 0.5-38.0). most of these mutations map to key functional domains of sur1. whereas kir6.2 mutations are a common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes and in a few cases associate with the dend (developmental delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes) syndrome, sur1 mutations are more frequent in transient (52%) compared with permanent (14%) neonatal diabetes cases screened for abcc8 in our series. although ketoacidosis is frequent at presentation, sur1 mutations associate mainly with transient hyperglycemia, with possible recurrence later in life. one-half of the sur1 neonatal diabetic patients presented with de novo mutations. in some familial cases, diabetes is not always present in the adult carriers of sur1 mutations, supporting variability in their clinical expressivity that remains to be fully explained.	-1
the effect of a single base pair deletion (delta t525) and a c1634t missense mutation (pro545leu) on the expression of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase in patients with glycogen storage disease type ii.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii, pompe's disease) is caused by an autosomal recessive inheritance of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase deficiency. by sequence analysis we have identified the mutations in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene (gaa) of two unrelated patients, who have one and two copies, respectively, of the same missense mutation. the milder affected adult patient was found to be homozygous for a c1634t transition resulting in the substitution of pro545 by leu. the more severely affected adolescent patient had this same mutant allele combined with a 1 base pair deletion (delta t525) in the second allele causing premature termination at nucleotide positions 658-660. both these mutations were introduced in wild-type alpha-glucosidase cdna and expressed in cos-1 cells to analyse their effect. the delta t525 mutation prohibits the formation of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase completely. the pro545-->leu substitution is compatible with normal synthesis but hampers enzyme maturation and results in a 92% net loss of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase activity. the patient with adult gsdii has, in accordance with the allelic constitution, a 2-fold higher residual activity than the patient with juvenile gsdii. the delta t525 deletion was detected in two other unrelated patients, and also the c1634t transition was encountered in two more caucasian patients with gsdii.	1
new population-based exome data are questioning the pathogenicity of previously cardiomyopathy-associated genetic variants.  cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases with various etiologies. we focused on three genetically determined cardiomyopathies: hypertrophic (hcm), dilated (dcm), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (arvc). eighty-four genes have so far been associated with these cardiomyopathies, but the disease-causing effect of reported variants is often dubious. in order to identify possible false-positive variants, we investigated the prevalence of previously reported cardiomyopathy-associated variants in recently published exome data. we searched for reported missense and nonsense variants in the nhlbi-go exome sequencing project (esp) containing exome data from 6500 individuals. in esp, we identified 94 variants out of 687 (14%) variants previously associated with hcm, 58 out of 337 (17%) variants associated with dcm, and 38 variants out of 209 (18%) associated with arvc. these findings correspond to a genotype prevalence of 1:4 for hcm, 1:6 for dcm, and 1:5 for arvc. polyphen-2 predictions were conducted on all previously published cardiomyopathy-associated missense variants. we found significant overrepresentation of variants predicted as being benign among those present in esp compared with the ones not present. in order to validate our findings, seven variants associated with cardiomyopathy were genotyped in a control population and this revealed frequencies comparable with the ones found in esp. in conclusion, we identified genotype prevalences up to more than one thousand times higher than expected from the phenotype prevalences in the general population (hcm 1:500, dcm 1:2500, and arvc 1:5000) and our data suggest that a high number of these variants are not monogenic causes of cardiomyopathy.	-1
intronic mutations outside of alu-repeat-rich domains of the ldl receptor gene are a cause of familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh), a frequent monogenic condition complicated by premature cardiovascular disease, is characterized by high allelic heterogeneity at the low-density lipoprotein receptor ( ldlr) locus. despite more than a decade of genetic testing, knowledge about intronic disease-causing mutations has remained limited because of lack of available genomic sequences. based on the finding from bioinformatic analysis that alu repeats represent 85% of ldlr intronic sequences outside exon-intron junctions, we designed a strategy to improve the exploration of genomic regions in the vicinity of exons in 110 fh subjects from an admixed population. in the first group of 42 patients of negative mutation carriers, as previously established by former screening strategies (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, dna sequencing with former primers overlapping splice-sites, southern blotting), about half ( n=22) were found to be carriers of at least one heterozygous mutation. among a second group of 68 newly recruited patients, 27% of mutation carriers ( n=37) had a splicing regulatory mutation. overall, out of the 54 mutations identified, 13 were intronic, and 18 were novel, out of which nearly half were intronic. two novel intronic mutations (ivs8-10g-->a within the polypyrimidine tract and ivs7+10g-->a downstream of donor site) might create potential aberrant splice sites according to neural-network computed estimation, contrary to 31 common single nucleotide variations also identified at exon-intron junctions. this new strategy of detecting the most likely disease-causing ldlr mutations outside of alu-rich genomic regions reveals that intronic mutations may have a greater impact than previously reported on the molecular basis of fh.	-1
alpha-galactosidase a p.a143t, a non-fabry disease-causing variant.  fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked multisystemic disorder with a heterogeneous phenotype. especially atypical or late-onset type 2 phenotypes present a therapeutical dilemma. to determine the clinical impact of the alpha-galactosidase a (gla) p.a143t/ c.427g > a variation, we retrospectively analyzed 25 p.a143t patients in comparison to 58 fd patients with other missense mutations. p.a143t patients suffering from stroke/ transient ischemic attacks had slightly decreased residual gla activities, and/or increased lyso-gb3 levels, suspecting fd. however, most male p.a143t patients presented with significant residual gla activity (~50 % of reference), which was associated with normal lyso-gb3 levels. additionally, p.a143t patients showed less severe fd-typical symptoms and absent fd-typical renal and cardiac involvement in comparison to fd patients with other missense mutations. two tested female p.a143t patients with stroke/tia did not show skewed x chromosome inactivation. no accumulation of neurologic events in family members of p.a143t patients with stroke/transient ischemic attacks was observed. we conclude that gla p.a143t seems to be most likely a neutral variant or a possible modifier instead of a disease-causing mutation. therefore, we suggest that p.a143t patients with stroke/transient ischemic attacks of unknown etiology should be further evaluated, since the diagnosis of fd is not probable and subsequent ert or chaperone treatment should not be an unreflected option.	1
cytoplasm-predominant pten associates with increased region-specific brain tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine d2 receptors in mouse model with autistic traits.  autism spectrum disorder (asd) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in social communication/interaction and inflexible/repetitive behavior. several lines of evidence support genetic factors as a predominant cause of asd. among those autism susceptibility genes that have been identified, the pten tumor suppressor gene, initially identified as predisposing to cowden heritable cancer syndrome, was found to be mutated in a subset of asd patients with extreme macrocephaly. however, the asd-relevant molecular mechanism mediating the effect of pten mutations remains elusive. we developed a pten knock-in murine model to study the effects of pten germline mutations, specifically altering subcellular localization, in asd. proteins were isolated from the hemispheres of the male littermates, and western blots were performed to determine protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (th). immunohistochemical stains were carried out to validate the localization of th and dopamine d2 receptors (d2r). pc12 cells ectopically expressing either wild-type or missense mutant pten were then compared for the differences in th expression. mice carrying pten mutations have high th and d2r in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. they also have increased phosphorylation of camp response element-binding protein (creb) and th. mechanistically, pten downregulates th production in pc12 cells via inhibiting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k)/creb signaling pathway, while pten reduces th phosphorylation via suppressing mapk pathway. unlike wild-type pten but similar to the mouse knock-in mutant pten, three naturally occurring missense mutations of pten that we previously identified in asd patients, h93r, f241s, and d252g, were not able to suppress th when overexpressed in pc12 cells. in addition, two other pten missense mutations, c124s (pan phosphatase dead) and g129e (lipid phosphatase dead), failed to suppress th when ectopically expressed in pc12 cells. our data reveal a non-canonical pten-th pathway in the brain that may work as a core regulator of dopamine signaling, which when dysfunctional is pathogenic in asd.	1
impacts of usher syndrome type ib mutations on human myosin viia motor function.  usher syndrome (ush) is a human hereditary disorder characterized by profound congenital deafness, retinitis pigmentosa, and vestibular dysfunction. myosin viia has been identified as the responsible gene for ush type 1b, and a number of missense mutations have been identified in the affected families. however, the molecular basis of the dysfunction of ush gene, myosin viia, in the affected families is unknown to date. here we clarified the effects of ush1b mutations on human myosin viia motor function for the first time. the missense mutations of ush1b significantly inhibited the actin activation of atpase activity of myosin viia. g25r, r212c, a397d, and e450q mutations abolished the actin-activated atpase activity completely. p503l mutation increased the basal atpase activity for 2-3-fold but reduced the actin-activated atpase activity to 50% of the wild type. while all of the mutations examined, except for r302h, reduced the affinity for actin and the atp hydrolysis cycling rate, they did not largely decrease the rate of adp release from actomyosin, suggesting that the mutations reduce the duty ratio of myosin viia. taken together, the results suggest that the mutations responsible for ush1b cause the complete loss of the actin-activated atpase activity or the reduction of duty ratio of myosin viia.	1
in vitro expression analysis of r68g and r68s mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  phenylketonuria (pku), an autosomal recessive disorder caused be a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah), is clinically very heterogeneous. at the molecular level, more than 400 mutations in the pah gene are known to date, which in different genotype combinations could account for biochemical and clinical variability of symptoms. in vitro expression studies on r68g and r68s mutations causing mild phenylketonuria are presented.	1
the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy myosin mutation r453c alters atp binding and hydrolysis of human cardiac ?-myosin.  the human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutation r453c results in one of the more severe forms of the myopathy. arg-453 is found in a conserved surface loop of the upper 50-kda domain of the myosin motor domain and lies between the nucleotide binding pocket and the actin binding site. it connects to the cardiomyopathy loop via a long ?-helix, helix o, and to switch-2 via the fifth strand of the central ?-sheet. the mutation is, therefore, in a position to perturb a wide range of myosin molecular activities. we report here the first detailed biochemical kinetic analysis of the motor domain of the human ?-cardiac myosin carrying the r453c mutation. a recent report of the same mutation (sommese, r. f., sung, j., nag, s., sutton, s., deacon, j. c., choe, e., leinwand, l. a., ruppel, k., and spudich, j. a. (2013) proc. natl. acad. sci. u.s.a. 110, 12607-12612) found reduced atpase and in vitro motility but increased force production using an optical trap. surprisingly, our results show that the mutation alters few biochemical kinetic parameters significantly. the exceptions are the rate constants for atp binding to the motor domain (reduced by 35%) and the atp hydrolysis step/recovery stroke (slowed 3-fold), which could be the rate-limiting step for the atpase cycle. effects of the mutation on the recovery stroke are consistent with a perturbation of switch-2 closure, which is required for the recovery stroke and the subsequent atp hydrolysis.	1
from clinicogenetic studies of maturity-onset diabetes of the young to unraveling complex mechanisms of glucokinase regulation.  glucokinase functions as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta-cells and regulates hepatic glucose metabolism. a total of 83 probands were referred for a diagnostic screening of mutations in the glucokinase (gck) gene. we found 11 different mutations (v62a, g72r, l146r, a208t, m210k, y215x, s263p, e339g, r377c, s453l, and ivs5 + 1g>c) in 14 probands. functional characterization of recombinant glutathionyl s-transferase-g72r glucokinase showed slightly increased activity, whereas s263p and g264s had near-normal activity. the other point mutations were inactivating. s263p showed marked thermal instability, whereas the stability of g72r and g264s differed only slightly from that of wild type. g72r and m210k did not respond to an allosteric glucokinase activator (gka) or the hepatic glucokinase regulatory protein (gkrp). mutation analysis of the role of glycine at position 72 by substituting e, f, k, m, s, or q showed that g is unique since all these mutants had very low or no activity and were refractory to gkrp and gka. structural analysis provided plausible explanations for the drug resistance of g72r and m210k. our study provides further evidence that protein instability in combination with loss of control by a putative endogenous activator and gkrp could be involved in the development of hyperglycemia in maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 2. furthermore, based on data obtained on g264s, we propose that other and still unknown mechanisms participate in the regulation of glucokinase.	1
transcriptional functionality of germ line p53 mutants influences cancer phenotype.  the tp53 tumor suppressor gene encodes a sequence-specific transcription factor that is able to transactivate several sets of genes, the promoters of which include appropriate response elements. although human cancers frequently contain mutated p53, the alleles as well as the clinical expression are often heterogeneous. germ line mutations of tp53 result in cancer proneness syndromes known as li-fraumeni, li-fraumeni--like, and nonsyndromic predisposition with or without family history. p53 mutants can be classified as partial deficiency alleles or severe deficiency alleles depending on their ability to transactivate a set of human target sequences, as measured using a standardized yeast-based assay (see http://www.umd.be:2072/index.html). we have investigated the extent to which the functional features of p53 mutant alleles determine clinical features in patients who have inherited these alleles and have developed cancer. we retrieved clinical data from the iarc database (see http://www.p53.iarc.fr/germline.html) for all cancer patients with germ line p53 mutations and applied stringent statistical evaluations to compare the functional classification of p53 alleles with clinical phenotypes. our analyses reveal that partial deficiency alleles are associated with a milder family history (p = 0.007), a lower numbers of tumors (p = 0.007), and a delayed disease onset (median, 31 versus 15 years; p = 0.007) which could be related to distinct tumor spectra. these findings establish for the first time significant correlations between the residual transactivation function of individual tp53 alleles and clinical variables in patients with inherited p53 mutations who develop cancer.	-1
germline mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene pten are rare in high-risk non-brca1/2 french canadian breast cancer families.  cowden syndrome is a disease associated with an increase in breast cancer susceptibility. alleles in pten and other breast cancer susceptibility genes would be responsible for approximately 25% of the familial component of breast cancer risk, brca1 and brca2 being the two major genes responsible for this inherited risk. in order to evaluate the proportion of high-risk french canadian non-brca1/brca2 breast/ovarian cancer families potentially harboring a pten germline mutation, the whole coding and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed in a series of 98 breast cancer cases. although no germline mutation has been identified in the coding region, our study led to the identification of four intronic variants. further investigations were performed to analyze the effect of these variants, alone and/or in combination, on splicing and pten protein levels. despite suggestive evidence emerging from in silico analyses, the presence of these intronic variants do not seem to alter rna splicing or pten protein levels. in addition, as loss of pten or part of it has been reported, western blot analysis has also been performed. no major deletion could be identified in our cohort. therefore, assuming a poisson distribution for the frequency of deleterious mutation in our cohort, if the frequency of such deleterious mutation was 2%, we would have had a 90% or greater chance of observing at least one such mutation. these results suggest that pten germline mutations are rare and are unlikely to account for a significant proportion of familial breast cancer cases in the french canadian population.	1
patients with obesity caused by melanocortin-4 receptor mutations can be treated with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.  pathogenic mutations in the appetite-regulating melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) represent the most common cause of monogenic obesity with limited treatment options. glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (glp-1 ras) cause weight loss by reducing appetite. we assessed the effect of the glp-1 ra liraglutide 3.0 mg for 16 weeks in 14 obese individuals with pathogenic mc4r mutations (bmi 37.5  6.8) and 28 matched control participants without mc4r mutation (bmi 36.8  4.8). liraglutide decreased body weight by 6.8 kg  1.8 kg in individuals with pathogenic mc4r mutations and by 6.1 kg  1.2 kg in control participants. total body fat, waist circumference, and fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations similarly decreased in both groups. thus, liraglutide induced an equal, clinically significant weight loss of 6% in both groups, indicating that the appetite-reducing effect of liraglutide is preserved in mc4r causal obesity and that liraglutide acts independently of the mc4r pathway. thus, liraglutide could be an effective treatment of the most common form of monogenic obesity.	-1
molecular basis for nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia.  nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia (non-pku hpa) is defined as phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency with blood phenylalanine levels below 600 mumol/liter (i.e., within the therapeutic range) on a normal dietary intake. haplotype analysis at the pah locus was performed in 17 danish families with non-pku hpa, revealing compound heterozygosity in all individuals. by allele-specific oligonucleotide (aso) probing for common pku mutations we found 12 of 17 non-pku hpa children with a pku allele on one chromosome. to identify molecular lesions in the second allele, individual exons were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism. two new missense mutations were identified. three children had inherited a g-to-a transition at codon 415 in exon 12 of the pah gene, resulting in the substitution of asparagine for aspartate, whereas one child possessed an a-to-g transition at codon 306 in exon 9, causing the replacement of an isoleucine by a valine in the enzyme. it is further demonstrated that the identified mutations have less impact on the heterozygote's ability to hydroxylate phenylalanine to tyrosine compared to the parents carrying a pku mutation. the combined effect on pah activity explains the non-pku hpa phenotype of the child. the present observations that pku mutations in combination with other mutations result in the non-pku hpa phenotype and that particular mutation-restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype combinations are associated with this phenotype offer the possibility of distinguishing pku patients from non-pku individuals by means of molecular analysis of the hyperphenylalaninemic neonate and, consequently, of determining whether a newborn child requires dietary treatment.	-1
identification of eight novel glucokinase mutations in italian children with maturity-onset diabetes of the young.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by early onset non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, autosomal dominant inheritance, and primary defect in the function of the beta cells of the pancreas. mutations in the glucokinase (gck) gene account for 8%-56% of mody, with the highest prevalences being found in the southern europe. while screening for gck mutations in 28 mody families of italian origin, we identified 17 different mutations (corresponding to 61% prevalence), including eight previously undescribed ones. the novel sequence variants included five missense mutations (p.lys161asn c.483g>c in exon 4, p.phe171leu c.511t>c in exon 5 and p.thr228ala c.682a>g, p.thr228arg c.683c>g, p.gly258cys c.772g>t in exon 7), one nonsense mutation (p.ser383ter c.1148c>a in exon 9), the splice site variant c.1253+1g>t in intron 9, and the deletion of 12 nucleotides in exon 10 (p.ser433_ile436del c.1298_1309del12). our study indicates that mutations in the gck/mody2 gene are a very common cause of mody in the italian population and broadens our knowledge of the naturally occurring gck mutation repertoire.	-1
pediatric cardiomyopathy: importance of genetic and metabolic evaluation.  cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disease with a strong genetic component. a research-based pediatric cardiomyopathy registry identified familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 30% of children. however, these results predated clinical genetic testing. we determined the prevalence of familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 83 consecutive unrelated patients referred for genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy from 2006 to 2009. seventy-six percent of probands (n = 63) were categorized as familial, syndromic, or metabolic. forty-three percent (n = 18) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) patients had mutations in sarcomeric genes, with myh7 and mybpc3 mutations predominating. syndromic (17%; n = 7) and metabolic (26%; n = 11) causes were frequently identified in hcm patients. the metabolic subgroup was differentiated by decreased endocardial shortening fraction on echocardiography. dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) patients had similar rates of syndromic (20%; n = 5) and metabolic (16%; n = 4) causes, but fewer familial cases (24%; n = 6) compared with hcm patients. the cause of cardiomyopathy is identifiable in a majority of affected children. an underlying metabolic or syndromic cause is identified in >35% of children with hcm or dcm. identification of etiology is important for management, family-based risk assessment, and screening.	-1
identification and characterization of aberrant gaa pre-mrna splicing in pompe disease using a generic approach.  identification of pathogenic variants in monogenic diseases is an important aspect of diagnosis, genetic counseling, and prediction of disease severity. pathogenic mechanisms involved include changes in gene expression, rna processing, and protein translation. variants affecting pre-mrna splicing are difficult to predict due to the complex mechanism of splicing regulation. a generic approach to systematically detect and characterize effects of sequence variants on splicing would improve current diagnostic practice. here, it is shown that such approach is feasible by combining flanking exon rt-pcr, sequence analysis of pcr products, and exon-internal quantitative rt-pcr for all coding exons. application of this approach to one novel and six previously published variants in the acid-alpha glucosidase (gaa) gene causing pompe disease enabled detection of a total of 11 novel splicing events. aberrant splicing included cryptic splice-site usage, intron retention, and exon skipping. importantly, the extent of leaky wild-type splicing correlated with disease onset and severity. these results indicate that this approach enables sensitive detection and in-depth characterization of variants affecting splicing, many of which are still unrecognized or poorly understood. the approach is generic and should be adaptable for application to other monogenic diseases to aid in improved diagnostics.	1
first description of germline mosaicism in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disease caused by mutations in seven sarcomeric protein genes. it is known to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with rare de novo mutations.a french family in which two members are affected by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was clinically screened with electrocardiography and echocardiography. genetic analyses were performed on leucocyte dna by haplotype analysis with microsatellite markers at the myh7 locus and mutation screening by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. two subjects exhibited severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. a mutation in the myh7 gene was found in exon 14 (arg453cys). the two affected patients were carriers of the mutation, which was not found in the circulating lymphocytes of their parents. haplotype analysis at the myh7 locus with two intragenic microsatellite markers (myoi and myoii) and the absence of the mutation in the father's sperm dna suggested that the mutation had been inherited from the mother. however, it was not found in either her fibroblasts or hair. this is the first description of germline mosaicism shown by molecular genetic analysis in an autosomal dominant disorder and more especially in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this mosaicism had been inherited from the mother but did not affect her somatic cells. such a phenomenon might account for some de novo mutations in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	-1
connexin26 mutations associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss.  mutations in the gjb2 gene are a major cause of autosomal recessive and sporadic types of congenital deafness. the 35delg mutation is the most frequent type of mutation in white populations. however, several other forms were reported, such as 167delt among ashkenazi jews and r143w in africans. the present study investigated the mutations of connexin26 (cx26) found in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss (nshl) and newborns in the korean population. the sequencing data for 147 unrelated patients with congenital nshl and 100 audiologically screened newborns were included in this prospective study. genomic dna samples from all patients and newborns were sequenced in both directions for detection of cx26 mutations. thirteen different types of mutations were found in the patients and newborns. v27i and e114g are the popular types of polymorphic mutations in both groups. 235delc-deletion and frameshift--was detected in patients (15 in 294 alleles) and newborns (1 in 200 alleles). 35delg was rarely found in both group. in addition to above mutations, several types of mutations--s85p, k41r, s72c, v84a, 176-191del, and 299-300del-were identified. the family study of the 235delc showed a typical autosomal recessive trait of nshl in their audiological evaluation of hearing threshold. the frequency of 235delc allele showed much higher in the patients (5%) than in newborns (0.5%). we rarely found 35delc mutant in both groups. these results suggest that the different types of cx26 mutations affect autosomal recessive nshl according to ethnic background.	-1
slow, progressive myopathy in neonatally treated patients with infantile-onset pompe disease: a muscle magnetic resonance imaging study.  patients with infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd) can be identified through newborn screening, and the subsequent immediate initiation of enzyme replacement therapy significantly improves the prognosis of these patients. however, they still present residual muscle weakness. in the present study, we used longitudinal muscle magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to determine whether this condition is progressive. a cohort of classic iopd patients who were diagnosed through newborn screening were treated with recombinant human acid ?-glucosidase (rhgaa) and followed prospectively from birth. the trunk (and abdominal wall), pelvis and upper thighs were scanned for muscle mri every 2-3 years. seven groups of muscles were individually scored from 0 to 4 based on the extent of their involvement, and the sum was correlated to the clinical manifestations. twenty-four mri scans from a total of 12 neonatally treated iopd patients were analyzed in the present study. the median age at the time of mri scanning was 4.2 years (13 days to 9 years). high intensity over the quadriceps on t2-weighted and short-tau inversion recovery images was observed in all scans and was followed by a decrease in muscle mass. trunk muscle involvement was slower, except in one patient who exhibited progressive psoas atrophy. among the 10 patients for whom follow-up scans were repeated more than 2 years after the first scan, four patients (40 %) showed increased myopathy severity. this prospective muscle mri study provides evidence for the occurrence of slow, progressive muscle damage in neonatally treated iopd patients during childhood. new treatment strategies are necessary to improve outcomes in these patients.	-1
functional assessment of allelic variants in the slc26a4 gene involved in pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic eva.  pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, with malformations of the inner ear, ranging from enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) to mondini malformation, and deficient iodide organification in the thyroid gland. nonsyndromic eva (ns-eva) is a separate type of sensorineural hearing loss showing normal thyroid function. both pendred syndrome and ns-eva seem to be linked to the malfunction of pendrin (slc26a4), a membrane transporter able to exchange anions between the cytosol and extracellular fluid. in the past, the pathogenicity of slc26a4 missense mutations were assumed if the mutations fulfilled two criteria: low incidence of the mutation in the control population and substitution of evolutionary conserved amino acids. here we show that these criteria are insufficient to make meaningful predictions about the effect of these slc26a4 variants on the pendrin-induced ion transport. furthermore, we functionally characterized 10 missense mutations within the slc26a4 orf, and consistently found that on the protein level, an addition or omission of a proline or a charged amino acid in the slc26a4 sequence is detrimental to its function. these types of changes may be adequate for predicting slc26a4 functionality in the absence of direct functional tests.	-1
hereditary leukemia due to rare runx1c splice variant (l472x) presents with eczematous phenotype.  deleterious mutations in the runx1 gene cause hereditary leukemia due to a rare syndrome called familial platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (fpdmm). we describe the characteristics of a family with fpdmm due to a novel runx1 mutation (l472x), located in the most 3-prime end of the gene reported to date. our 36-year old proband presented with incidentally detected thrombocytopenia and a family history suggestive of fpdmm. contrary to previously described families, affected members of our kindred express an eczematous phenotype, reportedly most severe in members who develop leukemia. pedigree analysis shows that the l472x mutation tracks with thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, and eczema. the l472x mutation produces a stably expressed runx1 protein product with a corresponding decrease in wild type runx1 expression. our data supports the inclusion of eczema in the fpdmm phenotype and suggests the possibility that the runx1 l472x mutant causes the type of dominant negative affect that is associated with an elevated risk of leukemia in fpdmm families.	1
new and rare gjb2 alleles in patients with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment: a genotype/auditory phenotype correlation.  the aim of the study is to report the new and rare gjb2 variants identified in individuals with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing impairment (hi) in a retrospective study based on 498 patients referred to the otolaryngology and medical genetics units of the modena university hospital, italy, with the purpose of building new genotype/auditory phenotype correlations for the gjb2 gene. a total of eight variants identified in hi patients under study were considered rare for their frequency below 1% in the general population and in the hi databases. of those, four (i20t, v95m, n206s, c.-22-2a>c) were in compound heterozygosity with known mutations resulting in a range of phenotypes from mild to profound, whereas four (w3r, c218y, k221n, c.-22-6t>c) were found in simple heterozygosity (for those only in silico prediction of pathogenicity was possible due to the absence of a second gjb2 or gjb6 mutation). based on patients' phenotype, reported frequency, and in silico prediction analysis, we suggest the prognostic value of eight rare and new gjb2 alleles, which may be of help to the clinician in counseling patients who carry such variants.	-1
new mutations in the gla gene in brazilian families with fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism that results from mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a (gla) gene. evaluating the enzymatic activity in male individuals usually performs the diagnosis of the disease, but in female carriers the diagnosis based only on enzyme assays is often inconclusive. in this work, we analyzed 568 individuals from 102 families with suspect of fd. overall, 51 families presented 38 alterations in the gla gene, among which 19 were not previously reported in literature. the alterations included 17 missense mutations, 7 nonsense mutations, 7 deletions, 6 insertions and 1 in the splice site. six alterations (r112c, r118c, r220x, r227x, r342q and r356w) occurred at cpg dinucleotides. five mutations not previously described in the literature (a156d, k237x, a292v, i317s, c.1177_1178insg) were correlated with low gla enzyme activity and with prediction of molecular damages. from the 13 deletions and insertions, 7 occurred in exons 6 or 7 (54%) and 11 led to the formation of a stop codon. the present study highlights the detection of new genomic alterations in the gla gene in the brazilian population, facilitating the selection of patients for recombinant enzyme-replacement trials and offering the possibility to perform prenatal diagnosis.	-1
ptpn11, sos1, kras, and raf1 gene analysis, and genotype-phenotype correlation in korean patients with noonan syndrome.  after 2006, germline mutations in the kras, sos1, and raf1 genes were reported to cause noonan syndrome (ns), in addition to the ptpn11 gene, and now we can find the etiology of disease in approximately 60-70% of ns cases. the aim of this study was to assess the correlation between phenotype and genotype by molecular analysis of the ptpn11, sos1, kras, and raf1 genes in 59 korean patients with ns. we found disease-causing mutations in 30 (50.8%) patients, which were located in the ptpn11 (27.1%), sos1 (16.9%), kras (1.7%), and raf1 (5.1%) genes. three novel mutations (t59a in ptpn11, k170e in sos1, s259t in raf1) were identified. the patients with ptpn11 mutations showed higher prevalences of patent ductus arteriosus and thrombocytopenia. the patients with sos1 mutations had a lower prevalence of delayed psychomotor development. all patients with raf1 mutations had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. typical facial features and auxological parameters were, on statistical analysis, not significantly different between the groups. the molecular defects of ns are genetically heterogeneous and involve several genes other than ptpn11 related to the ras-mapk pathway.	-1
"prevalence of melanocortin-4 receptor deficiency in europeans and their age-dependent penetrance in multigenerational pedigrees.  melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) deficiency is the most frequent genetic cause of obesity. however, there is uncertainty regarding the degree of penetrance of this condition, and the putative impact of the environment on the development of obesity in mc4r mutation carriers is unknown. we determined the mc4r sequence in 2,257 obese individuals and 2,677 nonobese control subjects of european origin and established the likely functional impact of all variants detected. we then included relatives of probands carriers and studied 25 pedigrees, including 97 carriers and 94 noncarriers from three generations. of the mc4r nonsynonymous mutations found in obese subjects, 68% resulted in a loss of function in vitro. they were found in 1.72% of obese versus 0.15% of nonobesed subjects (p = 6.9 x 10(-10)). among the families, abnormal eating behavior was more frequent in both mc4r-deficient children and adults than in noncarriers. although bmi was inversely associated with educational status in noncarrier adults, no such relationship was seen in mc4r mutation carriers. we observed a generational effect, with a penetrance of 40% in mc4r-deficient adults aged >52 years, 60% in 18- to 52-year-old adults, and 79% in children. the longitudinal study of adult carriers showed an increasing age-dependent penetrance (37% at 20 years versus 60% at >40 years). we have established a robust estimate of age-related penetrance for mc4r deficiency and demonstrated a generational effect on penetrance, which may relate to the development of an ""obesogenic"" environment. it remains to be seen whether appropriate manipulation of environmental factors may contribute to preventing the development of obesity even in those strongly genetically predisposed to it."	-1
successful treatment of an unresectable choroid plexus carcinoma in a patient with li-fraumeni syndrome.  choroid plexus carcinoma (cpc) is an uncommon central nervous system tumor requiring complete surgical excision for favorable outcome. the authors report the successful treatment of a 2-year-old patient with widely disseminated cpc and li-fraumeni syndrome. following a partial resection of the tumor the patient received chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin. there were no additional surgical procedures and radiation was not administered. remarkably, the patient remains without evidence of active disease more than 3 years from the completion of therapy. additional studies are necessary to determine whether this treatment plan can be beneficial to other patients with cpc and whether the patient's p53 mutation had an effect on outcome.	-1
a saturation mutagenesis approach to understanding pten lipid phosphatase activity and genotype-phenotype relationships.  phosphatase and tensin homolog (pten) is a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in diverse cancers. germline pten mutations are also associated with a range of clinical outcomes, including pten hamartoma tumor syndrome (phts) and autism spectrum disorder (asd). to empower new insights into pten function and clinically relevant genotype-phenotype relationships, we systematically evaluated the effect of pten mutations on lipid phosphatase activity in vivo. using a massively parallel approach that leverages an artificial humanized yeast model, we derived high-confidence estimates of functional impact for 7,244 single amino acid pten variants (86% of possible). we identified 2,273 mutations with reduced cellular lipid phosphatase activity, which includes 1,789 missense mutations. these data recapitulated known functional findings but also uncovered new insights into pten protein structure, biochemistry, and mutation tolerance. several residues in the catalytic pocket showed surprising mutational tolerance. we identified that the solvent exposure of wild-type residues is a critical determinant of mutational tolerance. further, we created a comprehensive functional map by leveraging correlations between amino acid substitutions to impute functional scores for all variants, including those not present in the assay. variant functional scores can reliably discriminate likely pathogenic from benign alleles. further, 32% of clinvar unclassified missense variants are phosphatase deficient in our assay, supporting their reclassification. asd-associated mutations generally had less severe fitness scores relative to phts-associated mutations (p = 7.16  10-5) and a higher fraction of hypomorphic mutations, arguing for continued genotype-phenotype studies in larger clinical datasets that can further leverage these rich functional data.	1
prospective functional classification of all possible missense variants in pparg.  clinical exome sequencing routinely identifies missense variants in disease-related genes, but functional characterization is rarely undertaken, leading to diagnostic uncertainty. for example, mutations in pparg cause mendelian lipodystrophy and increase risk of type 2 diabetes (t2d). although approximately 1 in 500 people harbor missense variants in pparg, most are of unknown consequence. to prospectively characterize ppar? variants, we used highly parallel oligonucleotide synthesis to construct a library encoding all 9,595 possible single-amino acid substitutions. we developed a pooled functional assay in human macrophages, experimentally evaluated all protein variants, and used the experimental data to train a variant classifier by supervised machine learning. when applied to 55 new missense variants identified in population-based and clinical sequencing, the classifier annotated 6 variants as pathogenic; these were subsequently validated by single-variant assays. saturation mutagenesis and prospective experimental characterization can support immediate diagnostic interpretation of newly discovered missense variants in disease-related genes.	1
usher syndrome type 1 due to missense mutations on both cdh23 alleles: investigation of mrna splicing.  usher syndrome (ush) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and visual impairment due to retinitis pigmentosa. truncating mutations in the cadherin-23 gene (cdh23) result in usher syndrome type 1d (ush1d), whereas missense mutations affecting strongly conserved motifs of the cdh23 protein cause non-syndromic deafness (dfnb12). four missense mutations constitute an exception from this genotype-phenotype correlation: they have been described in ush1 patients in homozygous state. using a minigene assay, we have investigated these changes (c.1450g>c, p.a484p; c.3625a>g, p.t1209a; c.4520g>a, p.r1507q; and c.5237g>a, p.r1746q) for a possible impact on mrna splicing which could explain the syndromic phenotype. while in silico analysis suggested impairment of splicing in all four cases, we found aberrant splicing for only one mutation, p.r1746q. however, splicing was normal in case of p.a484p, p.t1209a and p.r1507q. these three latter cdh23 missense mutations could interfere with functions of both, the auditory and the visual system. alternatively, they could represent rare non-pathogenic polymorphisms.	1

pten coordinates g(1) arrest by down-regulating cyclin d1 via its protein phosphatase activity and up-regulating p27 via its lipid phosphatase activity in a breast cancer model.  the tumour suppressor gene pten/mmac1/tep1 encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase that recognizes phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate and protein substrates. we have shown previously that over-expression of pten in a tetracycline-controlled inducible system blocks cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis in mcf-7 breast cancer cells. here, we demonstrate that over-expression of wild-type pten leads to the suppression of cell growth through the blockade of cell cycle progression, an increase in the abundance of p27, a decrease in the protein levels of cyclin d1 and the inhibition of akt phosphorylation. in contrast, expression of the phosphatase-dead mutant, c124s, promotes cell growth and has the opposite effect on the abundance of p27, cyclin d1 levels and the phosphorylation of akt. the g129e mutant, which does not have lipid phosphatase activity but retains protein phosphatase activity, behaves like c124s except that the former causes decreases in cyclin d1 levels similar to wild-type pten. therefore, pten exerts its growth suppression through lipid phosphatase-dependent and independent activities and most likely, via the coordinate effect of both protein phosphatase and lipid phosphatase activities. addition of either estrogen or insulin abrogates pten-mediated up-regulation of p27 and partially blocks pten-mediated growth suppression, whereas the combination of estrogen and insulin eliminates the alterations of p27 and cyclin d1 and completely blocks pten-mediated growth suppression. our findings demonstrate that pten blocks cell cycle progression differentially through down-regulating the positive cell cycle regulator, cyclin d1, by its protein phosphatase activity, and up-regulating the negative cell cycle regulator, p27, by its lipid phosphatase activity.	1
functional characterization and pharmacological rescue of melanocortin-4 receptor mutations identified from obese patients.  as the most common monogenic form of human obesity, about 130 naturally occurring melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) gene mutations have been identified. in this study, we reported detailed functional characterization of 10 novel human mc4r (hmc4r) mutants including r7c, c84r, s127l, s136f, w174c, a219v, p230l, f261s, i317v and l325f. flow cytometry experiments showed that six mutants, including r7c, c84r, s127l, w174c, p230l and f261s, have decreased cell surface expression. the other four mutants are expressed at similar levels as the wild-type hmc4r. binding assays showed that the mutants have similar binding affinities for the agonist and endogenous antagonist agouti-related protein. signalling assays showed that s136f is defective in signalling. multiple mutagenesis showed that s136 of hmc4r is required for the normal function of the receptor. to identify potential therapeutic approaches for patients with intracellularly retained mc4r mutants, we tested the effect of an mc4r inverse agonist, ml00253764, on c84r and w174c. we showed that ml00253764 could function as a pharmacological chaperone rescuing the mutant mc4rs to the cell surface. the rescued mutants are functional with increased camp production in response to agonist stimulation. in conclusion, of 10 mutants we studied, 6 had decreased cell surface expression. pharmacological chaperone is a potential approach for treating obesity caused by mc4r mutations that result in intracellular retention.	1
fast clinical molecular diagnosis of hyperphenylalaninemia using next-generation sequencing-based on a custom ampliseq panel and ion torrent pgm sequencing.  hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) can be classified into phenylketonuria (pku) and tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency (bh4d), according to the defect of enzyme activity, both of which vary substantially in severity, treatment, and prognosis of the disease. to set up a fast and comprehensive assay in order to achieve early etiological diagnosis and differential diagnosis for children with hpa, we designed a custom ampliseq panel for the sequencing of coding dna sequence (cds), flanking introns, 5' untranslated region (utr) and 3' utr from five hpa-causing genes (pah, pts, qdpr, gch1, and pcbd1) using the ion torrent personal genome machine (pgm) sequencer. a standard group of 15 samples with previously known dna sequences and a test group of 37 hpa patients with unknown mutations were used for assay validation and application, respectively. all variations were confirmed by sanger sequencing. in the standard group, all the known mutations were detected and were consistent with the results of previous sanger sequencing. in the test group, we identified mutations in 71 of 74 alleles, with a mutation detection rate of 95.9%. we also found a frame shift deletion p.ile25metfs*13 in pah that was previously unreported. in addition, 1 of 37 in the test group was inconsistent with either the molecular diagnosis or clinical diagnosis by traditional differential methods. in conclusion, our comprehensive assay based on a custom ampliseq panel and ion torrent pgm sequencing has wider coverage, higher throughput, is much faster, and more efficient when compared with the traditional molecular detection method for hpa patients, which could meet the medical need for individualized diagnosis and treatment.	-1
recurrence of pompe disease in first cousins.  we report on the cases of two first-degree non-consanguineous cousins with infantile-onset pompe disease, a rare autosomal recessive disease. the first patient developed cardiorespiratory failure at age 1 year. when she was 4 her male cousin developed hypotonia during his first month of life. both infants had cardiac hypertrophy at diagnosis and shared the c.1927g>a missense mutation. since a first degree cousin of an affected patient has 50 times the risk of developing the disease compared with unrelated infants and since cardiac hypertrophy is constant in affected infants, the combination of cardiac symptoms with a history of pompe disease in a first degree cousin leads to a very high probability of having the condition. clinically oriented screening based on simple diagnostic procedures such as echocardiogram and anamnesis could accelerate the initiation of enzyme replacement therapy of the deficient acid ?-glucosidase which is critical to restoring cardiac function in affected infants.	-1
a mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene in the israeli population.  hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) is a group of diseases characterized by a persistent elevation of phenylalanine levels in tissues and biological fluids. the most frequent form is phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, causing phenylketonuria (pku). among 159 israeli patients (jews, muslim and christian arabs and druze) with hpa, in whom at least one of the mutations was characterized, a total of 43 different mutations were detected, including seven novel ones. pku was very rare among ashkenazi jews and relatively frequent among jews from yemen, the caucasian mountains, bukhara and tunisia. the mutations responsible for the high frequency were: exon3del (yemenite jews), l48s (tunisian jews) and e178g, p281l and l48s (jews from the caucasian mountains and bukhara). among the non-jewish israeli citizens, the disease was relatively frequent in the negev and in the nazareth vicinity, and in many localities a unique mutation was detected, often in a single family. while marked genetic heterogeneity was observed in the arab and jewish populations, only one mutation a300s, was frequent in all of the communities. several of the other frequent mutations were shared by the non-ashkenazi jews and arabs; none were mutual to ashkenazi jews and arabs.	-1
complete exon sequencing of all known usher syndrome genes greatly improves molecular diagnosis.  usher syndrome (ush) combines sensorineural deafness with blindness. it is inherited in an autosomal recessive mode. early diagnosis is critical for adapted educational and patient management choices, and for genetic counseling. to date, nine causative genes have been identified for the three clinical subtypes (ush1, ush2 and ush3). current diagnostic strategies make use of a genotyping microarray that is based on the previously reported mutations. the purpose of this study was to design a more accurate molecular diagnosis tool. we sequenced the 366 coding exons and flanking regions of the nine known ush genes, in 54 ush patients (27 ush1, 21 ush2 and 6 ush3). biallelic mutations were detected in 39 patients (72%) and monoallelic mutations in an additional 10 patients (18.5%). in addition to biallelic mutations in one of the ush genes, presumably pathogenic mutations in another ush gene were detected in seven patients (13%), and another patient carried monoallelic mutations in three different ush genes. notably, none of the ush3 patients carried detectable mutations in the only known ush3 gene, whereas they all carried mutations in ush2 genes. most importantly, the currently used microarray would have detected only 30 of the 81 different mutations that we found, of which 39 (48%) were novel. based on these results, complete exon sequencing of the currently known ush genes stands as a definite improvement for molecular diagnosis of this disease, which is of utmost importance in the perspective of gene therapy.	-1
genotype-phenotype correlations analysis of mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene.  the aims of our research were to define the genotype-phenotype correlations of mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene that cause phenylketonuria (pku) among the israeli population. the mutation spectrum of the pah gene in pku patients in israel is described, along with a discussion on genotype-phenotype correlations. by using polymerase chain reaction/denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (pcr/dhplc) and dna sequencing, we screened all exons of the pah gene in 180 unrelated patients with four different pku phenotypes [classic pku, moderate pku, mild pku, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mhp)]. in 63.2% of patient genotypes, the metabolic phenotype could be predicted, though evidence is also found for both phenotypic inconsistencies among subjects with more than one type of mutation in the pah gene. data analysis revealed that about 25% of patients could participate in the future in (6r)-l: -erythro-5, 6, 7, 8-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) treatment trials according to their mutation genotypes. this study enables us to construct a national database in israel that will serve as a valuable tool for genetic counseling and a prognostic evaluation of future cases of pku.	-1
a molecular basis for familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: a beta cardiac myosin heavy chain gene missense mutation.  a point mutation in exon 13 of the beta cardiac myosin heavy chain (mhc) gene is present in all individuals affected with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (fhc) from a large kindred. this missense mutation converts a highly conserved arginine residue (arg-403) to a glutamine. affected individuals from an unrelated family lack this missense mutation, but instead have an alpha/beta cardiac mhc hybrid gene. identification of two unique mutations within cardiac mhc genes in all individuals with fhc from two unrelated families demonstrates that defects in the cardiac mhc genes can cause this disease. the pathology resulting from a missense mutation at residue 403 further suggests that a critical function of myosin is disrupted by this mutation.	-1
sequence variations in pcsk9, low ldl, and protection against coronary heart disease.  a low plasma level of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease (chd), but the effect of lifelong reductions in plasma ldl cholesterol is not known. we examined the effect of dna-sequence variations that reduce plasma levels of ldl cholesterol on the incidence of coronary events in a large population. we compared the incidence of chd (myocardial infarction, fatal chd, or coronary revascularization) over a 15-year interval in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study according to the presence or absence of sequence variants in the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease gene (pcsk9) that are associated with reduced plasma levels of ldl cholesterol. of the 3363 black subjects examined, 2.6 percent had nonsense mutations in pcsk9; these mutations were associated with a 28 percent reduction in mean ldl cholesterol and an 88 percent reduction in the risk of chd (p=0.008 for the reduction; hazard ratio, 0.11; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.81; p=0.03). of the 9524 white subjects examined, 3.2 percent had a sequence variation in pcsk9 that was associated with a 15 percent reduction in ldl cholesterol and a 47 percent reduction in the risk of chd (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.79; p=0.003). these data indicate that moderate lifelong reduction in the plasma level of ldl cholesterol is associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of coronary events, even in populations with a high prevalence of non-lipid-related cardiovascular risk factors.	-1
correction of kinetic and stability defects by tetrahydrobiopterin in phenylketonuria patients with certain phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations.  phenylketonuria patients harboring a subset of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) mutations have recently shown normalization of blood phenylalanine levels upon oral administration of the pah cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin [(6r)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4)]. several hypotheses have been put forward to explain bh4 responsiveness, but the molecular basis for the corrective effect(s) of bh4 has not been understood. we have investigated the biochemical, kinetic, and structural changes associated with bh4-responsive mutations (f39l, i65t, r68s, h170d, e178g, v190a, r261q, a300s, l308f, a313t, a373t, v388m, e390g, p407s, and y414c). the biochemical and kinetic characterization of the 15 mutants studied points toward a multifactorial basis for the bh4 responsiveness; the mutants show residual activity (>30% of wt) and display various kinetic defects, including increased km (bh4) and reduced cooperativity of substrate binding, but no decoupling of cofactor (bh4) oxidation. for some, bh4 seems to function through stabilization and protection of the enzyme from inactivation and proteolytic degradation. in the crystal structures of a phenylketonuria mutant, a313t, minor changes were seen when compared with the wt pah structures, consistent with the mild effects the mutant has upon activity of the enzyme both in vitro and in vivo. truncations made in the a313t mutant pah form revealed that the n and c termini of the enzyme influence active site binding. of fundamental importance is the observation that bh4 appears to increase phe catabolism if at least one of the two heterozygous mutations has any residual activity remaining.	-1
connexin26 mutations associated with the most common form of non-syndromic neurosensory autosomal recessive deafness (dfnb1) in mediterraneans.  non-syndromic neurosensory autosomal recessive deafness (nsrd) is the most common form of genetic hearing loss. previous studies defined at least 15 human nsrd loci. recently we demonstrated that dfnb1, located on the long arm of chromosome 13, accounts for approximately 80% of cases in the mediterranean area. further analysis with additional markers now identifies several recombinants which narrow the candidate region to approximately 5 cm, encompassed by markers d13s141 and d13s232 and including several ests and candidate genes, including the connexin26 (gjb2) gene. analysis of pcr products from our affected patients' dna shows two frameshift mutations in the connexin26 gene. deletion of a g within a stretch of six gs at position 35 of the gjb2 cdna (mutation 35delg) leads to premature chain termination and is present in 63% of nsrd chromosomes, demonstrating linkage to chromosome 13. deletion of a t at position 167 of gjb2 (mutation 167delt), also resulting in premature chain termination, was detected in another patient. four neutral sequence polymorphisms were also identified. these findings are in agreement with a recent study showing that mutations in the connexin26 gene are associated with genetic forms of deafness in three pakistani families and that gjb2 is dfnb1. connexin26 is a member of a large family of proteins involved in formation of gap junctions, which are involved in electrical synapses and the direct transfer of small molecules and ionic currents between neighboring cells. the identification of gjb2 as the dfnb1 gene should provide a better understanding of the biology of normal and abnormal hearing, help form the basis for diagnosis and may facilitate development of strategies for treatment of this common genetic disorder.	-1
a li-fraumeni syndrome family with retained heterozygosity for a germline tp53 mutation in two tumors.  we identified a missense germline mutation (gly245ser) in one of the mutation hot spots of the tp53 gene in two affected members of a li-fraumeni syndrome family. we also analyzed their tumors, a liposarcoma and a colorectal carcinoma. both tumors exhibited p53 protein accumulation but none of them showed loss of the wild-type allele of the tp53 gene. we reviewed all published cases of tumors in germline tp53 mutation carriers where loss of heterozygosity data were available and identified 84 tumors with loss of the wild-type allele, 57 tumors with retention of heterozygosity, and 9 tumors with loss of the allele harboring the germline mutation. among the tumors showing p53 accumulation, we observed a significant difference in the fraction of tumors showing p53 protein accumulation between the tumors with loss of the wild-type allele and those with retention of tp53 heterozygosity. this supports the idea that the pathogenesis of tumors in germline tp53 mutation carriers does not have to be associated with loss of the wild-type tp53 allele. the product of the normal allele can potentially be inactivated by a variety of other mechanisms or, as suggested by the analysis, many of these tumors may even preserve the activity of the wild-type p53 protein.	-1
tetrahydrobiopterin as an alternative treatment for mild phenylketonuria.  hyperphenylalaninemia is a common inherited metabolic disease that is due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, and at least half the affected patients have mild clinical phenotypes. treatment with a low-phenylalanine diet represents a substantial psychosocial burden, but alternative treatments have not been effective. to explore the therapeutic efficacy of tetrahydrobiopterin, we performed a combined phenylalanine-tetrahydrobiopterin loading test and analyzed the in vivo rates of [13c]phenylalanine oxidation in 38 children with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency (age range, 1 day to 17 years). we assessed whether responsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin was associated with specific genotypes, and we mapped mutations using a structural model of the phenylalanine hydroxylase monomer. in 27 (87 percent) of 31 patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (10 patients) or mild phenylketonuria (21 patients), tetrahydrobiopterin significantly lowered blood phenylalanine levels. phenylalanine oxidation was significantly enhanced in 23 of these 31 patients (74 percent). conversely, none of the seven patients with classic phenylketonuria had a response to tetrahydrobiopterin as defined in this study. long-term treatment with tetrahydrobiopterin in five children increased daily phenylalanine tolerance, allowing them to discontinue their restricted diets. seven mutations (p314s, y417h, v177m, v245a, a300s, e390g, and ivs4-5c-->g) were classified as probably associated with responsiveness to tetrahydrobiopterin, and six mutations (a403v, f39l, d415n, s310y, r158q, and i65t) were classified as potentially associated. four mutations (y414c, l48s, r261q, and i65v) were inconsistently associated with this phenotype. mutations connected to tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness were predominantly in the catalytic domain of the protein and were not directly involved in cofactor binding. tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness is common in patients with mild hyperphenylalaninemia phenotypes. responsiveness cannot consistently be predicted on the basis of genotype, particularly in compound heterozygotes.	-1
identification of 11 novel mutations in ush2a among japanese patients with usher syndrome type 2.  usher syndrome (ush) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss. ush type 2 (ush2) is the most common type of ush and is frequently caused by mutations in ush2a, which accounts for 74-90% of ush2 cases. this is the first study reporting the results of scanning for ush2a mutations in japanese patients with ush2. in 8 of 10 unrelated patients, we identified 14 different mutations. of these mutations, 11 were novel. although the mutation spectrum that we identified differed from that for caucasians, the incidence of mutations in ush2a was 80% for all patients tested, which is consistent with previous findings. further, c.8559-2a>g was identified in four patients and accounted for 26.7% of mutated alleles; it is thus a frequent mutation in japanese patients. hence, mutation screening for c.8559-2a>g in ush2a may prove very effective for the early diagnosis of ush2.	-1
effects of myosin variants on interacting-heads motif explain distinct hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy phenotypes.  cardiac ?-myosin variants cause hypertrophic (hcm) or dilated (dcm) cardiomyopathy by disrupting sarcomere contraction and relaxation. the locations of variants on isolated myosin head structures predict contractility effects but not the prominent relaxation and energetic deficits that characterize hcm. during relaxation, pairs of myosins form interacting-heads motif (ihm) structures that with other sarcomere proteins establish an energy-saving, super-relaxed (srx) state. using a human ?-cardiac myosin ihm quasi-atomic model, we defined interactions sites between adjacent myosin heads and associated protein partners, and then analyzed rare variants from 6112 hcm and 1315 dcm patients and 33,370 exac controls. hcm variants, 72% that changed electrostatic charges, disproportionately altered ihm interaction residues (expected 23%; hcm 54%, p=2.610-19; dcm 26%, p=0.66; controls 20%, p=0.23). hcm variant locations predict impaired ihm formation and stability, and attenuation of the srx state - accounting for altered contractility, reduced diastolic relaxation, and increased energy consumption, that fully characterizes hcm pathogenesis.	-1
rhbdf2 mutations are associated with tylosis, a familial esophageal cancer syndrome.  tylosis esophageal cancer (toc) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma, oral precursor lesions, and a high lifetime risk of esophageal cancer. we have previously localized the toc locus to a small genomic interval within chromosomal region 17q25. using a targeted capture array and next-generation sequencing, we have now identified missense mutations (c.557t>c [p.ile186thr] and c.566c>t [p.pro189leu] in rhbdf2, which encodes the inactive rhomboid protease rhbdf2 (also known as irhom2), as the underlying cause of toc. we show that the distribution of rhbdf2 in tylotic skin is altered in comparison with that in normal skin, and immortalized tylotic keratinocytes have decreased levels of total epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) and display an increased proliferative and migratory potential relative to normal cells, even when normal cells are stimulated with exogenous epidermal growth factor. it would thus appear that egfr signaling is dysregulated in tylotic cells. furthermore, we also show an altered localization of rhbdf2 in both tylotic and sporadic squamous esophageal tumors. the elucidation of a role of rhbdf2 in growth-factor signaling in esophageal cancer will help to determine whether targeting this pathway in chemotherapy for this and other squamous cell carcinomas will be effective.	-1
mapping the functional landscape of frequent phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) genotypes promotes personalised medicine in phenylketonuria.  in phenylketonuria, genetic heterogeneity, frequent compound heterozygosity, and the lack of functional data for phenylalanine hydroxylase genotypes hamper reliable phenotype prediction and individualised treatment. a literature search revealed 690 different phenylalanine hydroxylase genotypes in 3066 phenylketonuria patients from europe and the middle east. we determined phenylalanine hydroxylase function of 30 frequent homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes covering 55% of the study population, generated activity landscapes, and assessed the phenylalanine hydroxylase working range in the metabolic (phenylalanine) and therapeutic (tetrahydrobiopterin) space. shared patterns in genotype-specific functional landscapes were linked to biochemical and pharmacological phenotypes, where (1) residual activity below 3.5% was associated with classical phenylketonuria unresponsive to pharmacological treatment; (2) lack of defined peak activity induced loss of response to tetrahydrobiopterin; (3) a higher cofactor need was linked to inconsistent clinical phenotypes and low rates of tetrahydrobiopterin response; and (4) residual activity above 5%, a defined peak of activity, and a normal cofactor need were associated with pharmacologically treatable mild phenotypes. in addition, we provide a web application for retrieving country-specific information on genotypes and genotype-specific phenylalanine hydroxylase function that warrants continuous extension, updates, and research on demand. the combination of genotype-specific functional analyses with biochemical, clinical, and therapeutic data of individual patients may serve as a powerful tool to enable phenotype prediction and to establish personalised medicine strategies for dietary regimens and pharmacological treatment in phenylketonuria.	1
frequency of mutations in individuals with breast cancer referred for brca1 and brca2 testing using next-generation sequencing with a 25-gene panel.  next-generation sequencing (ngs) allows for simultaneous sequencing of multiple cancer susceptibility genes and, for an individual, may be more efficient and less expensive than sequential testing. the authors assessed the frequency of deleterious germline mutations among individuals with breast cancer who were referred for brca1 and brca2 (brca1/2) gene testing using a panel of 25 genes associated with inherited cancer predisposition. this was a cross-sectional study using ngs in 2158 individuals, including 1781 who were referred for commercial brca1/2 gene testing (cohort 1) and 377 who had detailed personal and family history and had previously tested negative for brca1/2 mutations (cohort 2). mutations were identified in 16 genes, most frequently in brca1, brca2, chek2, atm, and palb2. among the participants in cohort 1, 9.3% carried a brca1/2 mutation, 3.9% carried a mutation in another breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, and 0.3% carried an incidental mutation in another cancer susceptibility gene unrelated to breast or ovarian cancer. in cohort 2, the frequency of mutations in breast/ovarian-associated genes other than brca1/2 was 2.9%, and an additional 0.8% had an incidental mutation. in cohort 1, lynch syndrome-related mutations were identified in 7 individuals. in contrast to brca1/2 mutations, neither age at breast cancer diagnosis nor family history of ovarian or young breast cancer predicted for other mutations. the frequency of mutations in genes other than brca1/2 was lower in ashkenazi jews compared with non-ashkenazi individuals (p=.026). using an ngs 25-gene panel, the frequency of mutations in genes other than brca1/2 was 4.3%, and most mutations (3.9%) were identified in genes associated with breast/ovarian cancer.	-1
application of molecular genetics for diagnosing familial hypercholesterolemia in norway: results from a family-based screening program.  a total of 119 different mutations in the low-density lipoprotein-receptor gene have so far been found to cause familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) among norwegian patients. as of april 2003, 2390 patients from 959 unrelated families were provided with a molecular genetic diagnosis. of these, 25.3% had xanthomas and 8.4% had xanthelasma. during the last 2-3 years, a systematic family-based program to identify close relatives of fh patients has been established. a total of 851 relatives of 188 index patients have undergone genetic testing. four hundred seven people (47.9%) were affected, and 444 (52.1%) were unaffected. only 41.5% of those affected were on lipid-lowering drugs, and only 6.1% had a value for total serum cholesterol below 193 mg/dl (5.0 mmol/l). a follow-up study was conducted in 146 of 407 affected relatives 6 months after genetic testing was performed. of those already under treatment at the time of genetic testing, nonsignificant reductions of total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 3.2% and 7.1% were observed. of those not under treatment who were aged 18 years and older, the corresponding reductions were 21.2% (p <.0001) and 30.0% (p <.0001), respectively. we conclude that molecular genetic methods represent a feasible and highly efficient tool in a family-based strategy to diagnose fh.	-1
"altered-function p53 missense mutations identified in breast cancers can have subtle effects on transactivation.  mutations of the sequence-specific master regulator p53 that alter transactivation function from promoter response elements (re) could result in changes in the strength of gene activation or spectra of genes regulated. such mutations in this tumor suppressor might lead to dramatic phenotypic changes and diversification of cell responses to stress. we have determined ""functional fingerprints"" of sporadic breast cancer-related p53 mutants, many of which are also associated with familial cancer proneness such as the li-fraumeni syndrome and germline brca1/2 mutant-associated cancers. the ability of p53, wild-type and mutants, to transactivate from 11 human target res has been assessed at variable expression levels using a cellular, isogenomic yeast model system that allows for the rapid analysis of p53 function using a qualitative and a quantitative reporter. among 50 missense mutants, 29 were classified as loss of function. the remaining 21 retained transactivation toward at least one re. at high levels of galactose-induced p53 expression, 12 of 21 mutants that retain transactivation seemed similar to wild-type. when the level of galactose was reduced, transactivation defects could be revealed, suggesting that some breast cancer-related mutants can have subtle changes in transcription. these findings have been compared with clinical data from an ongoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment trial for locally advanced breast tumors. the functional and nonfunctional missense mutations may distinguish tumors in terms of demographics, appearance, and relapse, implying that heterogeneity in the functionality of specific p53 mutations could affect clinical behavior and outcome."	1
increased occurrence of cleft lip in glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii): exclusion of a contiguous gene syndrome in two patients by presence of intragenic mutations including a novel nonsense mutation gln58stop.  genetic deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase) results in the autosomal recessive disorder glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) in which intralysosomal accumulation of glycogen primarily affects function of skeletal and cardiac muscle. during an earlier review we noted 3 in 100 cases of gsdii with incidental description of cleft lip. in addition, we identified 2 of 35 gsdii patients referred to us for molecular studies with co-occurence of cleft lip, considerably greater than the estimated frequency of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate of 1 in 700 to 1,000. because several lines of evidence support a minor cleft lip/palate (cl/p) locus on chromosome 17q close to the locus for gsdii, we defined the molecular basis for the gsdii in these two patients to determine if they represented a contiguous gene syndrome. patient i (of dutch descent) was homozygous and the parents heterozygous for an intragenic deletion of exon 18 (deltaex18), common in dutch patients. patient ii was heterozygous for delta525t, a mutation also common in dutch patients and a novel nonsense mutation (172 [corrected] c-->t; gln58stop) in exon 2, the first coding exon. the mother was heterozygous for the delta525t and the father for the 172 [corrected] c-->t; gln58stop. the finding that both patients carried intragenic mutations eliminates a contiguous gene syndrome. whereas the presence of cleft lip/cleft palate in a patient with gsdii could be coincidental, these co-occurences could represent a modifying action of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency on unlinked or linked genes that result in increased susceptibility for cleft lip.	-1
pten hamartoma tumor syndrome and gorham-stout phenomenon.  pten: hamartoma tumor syndrome (phts) is a group of syndromes caused by mutations in pten. gorham-stout phenomenon (gsp) is a rare condition characterized by proliferation of vascular structures in bones, resulting in progressive osteolysis. here we present a 1-year-old boy with phts and gsp. the lesion that later proved to be gsp was evident from the age of 4 months, and became symptomatic at the age of 1 year. eventually, he developed a fatal chylothorax. mutation analysis revealed a germline heterozygous mutation c.517 c>t (p.arg173cys) in exon 6 of pten. analysis of the lymphatic malformation (lm) tissue revealed no loss of heterozygosity (loh) nor a second, somatic pten mutation of the remaining wild type allele. the germline p.arg173cys mutation was also present in the mother and the propositus' younger sister and brother. further molecular work-up showed a heterozygous variant c.2180c>t (p.ala727val) flt4 in the lm tissue, which was also present in the germline of mother and two siblings. gsp has not been reported before in a patient with a pten mutation. up to this date, this mutation is the only genetic defect possibly involved in the etiology of gsp which is plausible given the known function of pten in angiogenic signaling.	-1
mutational analysis of allosteric activation and inhibition of glucokinase.  gk (glucokinase) is activated by glucose binding to its substrate site, is inhibited by gkrp (gk regulatory protein) and stimulated by gkas (gk activator drugs). to explore further the mechanisms of these processes we studied pure recombinant human gk (normal enzyme and a selection of 31 mutants) using steady-state kinetics of the enzyme and tf (tryptophan fluorescence). tf studies of the normal binary gk-glucose complex corroborate recent crystallography studies showing that it exists in a closed conformation greatly different from the open conformation of the ligand-free structure, but indistinguishable from the ternary gk-glucose-gka complex. gkas did activate and gkrp did inhibit normal gk, whereas its tf was doubled by glucose saturation. however, the enzyme kinetics, gkrp inhibition, tf enhancement by glucose and responsiveness to gka of the selected mutants varied greatly. two predominant response patterns were identified accounting for nearly all mutants: (i) gk mutants with a normal or close to normal response to gka, normally low basal tf (indicating an open conformation), some variability of kinetic parameters (k(cat), glucose s(0.5), h and atp k(m)), but usually strong gkrp inhibition (13/31); and (ii) gk mutants that are refractory to gkas, exhibit relatively high basal tf (indicating structural compaction and partial closure), usually show strongly enhanced catalytic activity primarily due to lowering of the glucose s(0.5), but with reduced or no gkrp inhibition in most cases (14/31). these results and those of previous studies are best explained by envisioning a common allosteric regulator region with spatially non-overlapping gkrp- and gka-binding sites.	1
two mutations within the coding sequence of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  two previously unidentified mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus were found during a study of the relationship between genotype and phenotype in phenylketonuria and hyperphenylalaninemia. one mutation eliminates the bamhi site in exon 7 and the other eliminates the hindiii site in exon 11 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. they were suspected because of deviating restriction fragment patterns and confirmed by amplification, via the polymerase chain reaction, of exon 7 and exon 11, respectively, followed by digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme. direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 7 revealed a g/c to t/a transversion at the first base of codon 272, substituting a gga glycine codon for a uga stop codon. direct sequencing of amplified mutant exon 11 revealed a deletion of codon 364, a ctt leucine codon. the exon 7 mutation can be expected to result in a truncated protein and the exon 11 mutation in the elimination of an amino acid in the catalytic region of the enzyme. a patient who is a compound heterozygote for these two mutations has classical phenylketonuria. it is concluded that each of the two mutations leads to a profound loss of enzymatic activity. the segregation of these mutations with disease alleles in 4 and 2 families, respectively, supports the hypothesis that multiple mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus explain the variable phenylalanine tolerance in patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.	-1
"a search for three known ryr1 gene mutations in 41 swedish families with predisposition to malignant hyperthermia.  eight mutations in the gene (the ryr1 gene) encoding the calcium release channel of sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr) in skeletal muscle are so far known to be very closely linked to malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in man and are regarded to be causative. we have examined 41 swedish families where malignant hyperthermia had occurred in at least one member during anaesthesia, with respect to three of the known mutations. the mutations were arg163cys; ile403met and arg614cys (also known as the ""pig mutation""). in three (i.e. 7%) of the families we detected the arg614cys mutation, and this was the only one of the mutations searched for that was observed. this indicates that other mutations than those searched for in this study must cause malignant hyperthermia susceptibility in most swedish malignant hyperthermia susceptible families."	-1
analysis of prevalence and degree of macrocephaly in patients with germline pten mutations and of brain weight in pten knock-in murine model.  pten hamartoma tumour syndrome (phts) includes cowden syndrome (cs), bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs), and other conditions resulting from germline mutation of the pten tumour suppressor gene. although macrocephaly, presumably due to megencephaly, is found in both cs and brrs, the prevalence and degree have not been formally assessed in phts. we evaluated head size in a prospective nested series of 181 patients found to have pathogenic germline pten mutations. clinical data including occipital-frontal circumference (ofc) measurement were requested for all participants. macrocephaly was present in 94% of 161 evaluable phts individuals. in patients ? 18 years, mean ofc was +4.89 standard deviations (sd) above the population mean with no difference between genders (p = 0.7). among patients >18 years, average ofc was 60.0 cm in females and 62.8 cm in males (p < 0.0001). to systematically determine whether macrocephaly was due to megencephaly, we examined pten(m3m4) missense mutant mice generated and maintained on mixed backgrounds. mice were killed at various ages, brains were dissected out and weighed. average brain weight for pten(m3m4) homozygous mice (n = 15) was 1.02 g compared with 0.57 g for heterozygous mice (n = 29) and 0.49 g for wild-type littermates (n = 24) (p < 0.0001). macrocephaly, secondary to megencephaly, is an important component of phts and more prevalent than previously appreciated. patients with phts have increased risks for breast and thyroid cancers, and early diagnosis is key to initiating timely screening to reduce patient morbidity and mortality. clinicians should consider germline pten testing at an early point in the diagnostic work-up for patients with extreme macrocephaly.	-1
germline mutations in genes within the mapk pathway cause cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome.  cardio-facio-cutaneous (cfc) syndrome is a sporadic developmental disorder involving characteristic craniofacial features, cardiac defects, ectodermal abnormalities, and developmental delay. we demonstrate that heterogeneous de novo missense mutations in three genes within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway cause cfc syndrome. the majority of cases (18 out of 23) are caused by mutations in braf, a gene frequently mutated in cancer. of the 11 mutations identified, two result in amino acid substitutions that occur in tumors, but most are unique and suggest previously unknown mechanisms of b-raf activation. furthermore, three of five individuals without braf mutations had missense mutations in either mek1 or mek2, downstream effectors of b-raf. our findings highlight the involvement of the mapk pathway in human development and will provide a molecular diagnosis of cfc syndrome.	1
l-alanine supplementation in late infantile glycogen storage disease type ii.  we report a male with late infantile glycogen storage disease type ii (pompe's disease) who presented at 12 months of age with muscular hypotonia and developmental delay. oral supplementation with l-alanine has been administered for 5 years. progression of skeletal myopathy was slow, and cardiomyopathy resolved almost completely. l-alanine may be a valuable supplement for infants with glycogen storage disease type ii.	1
genetic variability of gckr alters lipid profiles in children with monogenic and autoimmune diabetes.  mutations in the glucokinase (gck) gene are associated with altered blood glucose and lipid concentrations. our aim was to assess the effects on hba1c and serum lipid levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) in 2 genes encoding proteins that interact with glucokinase: glucose-6-phospatase catalytic subunit 2 (g6pc2) and glucokinase regulatory protein (gckr). the study group included 129 children with gck-mody from the polish registry of monogenic diabetes and 395 with type 1 diabetes (t1dm), in whom we genotyped 2 snps in g6pc2 (rs560887) and gckr (rs1260326). lipid concentrations were assessed in fasting serum samples. total and hdl cholesterol concentrations were significantly lower in the gck-mody group than in patients with t1dm (167.532.5 mg/dl vs. 174.431.1 mg/dl, p=0.0435 and 48.4214.3 mg/dl vs. 58.712.7 mg/dl, p<0.0001, respectively). no differences in genotype distributions were found except for underrepresentation of gckr tt homozygotes among gck-mody patients (10.9% in gck-mody vs. 17.7% in t1dm, p=0.0651). gckr genotypes showed significant associations with lipid profiles and hba1c levels, whereas no such associations were noted for g6pc2. after adjustment for confounders, tt homozygotes were shown to have higher total cholesterol and marginally higher ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p=0.0245, p=0.0657 and p=0.0550, respectively). the difference between tt homozygotes and other genotypes was similar in magnitude within the gck-mody and t1dm groups. no significant interactions between the type of diabetes and the gckr or g6pc2 genotype were detected. individuals who are homozygous tt at rs1260326 of the gckr gene have higher triglyceride, total and ldl cholesterol levels regardless of the presence of gck mutations.	-1
mutation of a gene encoding a protein with extracellular matrix motifs in usher syndrome type iia.  usher syndrome type iia (omim 276901), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss and progressive retinitis pigmentosa, maps to the long arm of human chromosome 1q41 between markers afm268zd1 and afm144xf2. three biologically important mutations in usher syndrome type iia patients were identified in a gene (ush2a) isolated from this critical region. the ush2a gene encodes a protein with a predicted size of 171.5 kilodaltons that has laminin epidermal growth factor and fibronectin type iii motifs; these motifs are most commonly observed in proteins comprising components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes and in cell adhesion molecules.	-1
patient outcomes from a specialized inherited arrhythmia clinic.  patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (scd). specialized inherited arrhythmia clinics were founded to optimize management and prevention of scd in this population. however, the clinical effectiveness of these clinics has never been evaluated. clinical outcome data of patients referred to a specialized inherited arrhythmia clinic between 2005 and 2014 for a possible primary electric syndrome or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy were analyzed. of 720 patients evaluated, 278 received a definite or probable diagnosis and received long-term management in the inherited arrhythmia clinic. all patients diagnosed with long qt syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia received routine ?-blocker therapy and demonstrated >90% long-term compliance. in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, those demonstrating an arrhythmia burden on holter or treadmill testing received ?-blocker therapy (17%). in diagnosed channelopathy or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy index cases, 44 patients received secondary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (long qt syndrome, 9; brugada syndrome, 8; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, 3; short qt syndrome, 1; and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, 23). median follow-up was 4.1 years with 43% having a follow-up period of >5 years. scd occurred in a single patient (annualized risk of scd, 0.1% per year). in individuals determined to have clinical or genetic disease by cascade screening, no scd has occurred over a median follow-up of 5.6 years (55%, >5 years). low event rates occurred despite a low rate (4.0%) of primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator utilization. longitudinal care in a specialized inherited arrhythmia clinic is associated with a low incidence of scd and a low rate of primary implantable cardioverter-defibrillator utilization in patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes.	-1
aberrant splicing of phenylalanine hydroxylase mrna: the major cause for phenylketonuria in parts of southern europe.  we report a mutation within the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene that causes aberrant splicing of the mrna and that is in tight association with chromosomal haplotypes 6, 10, and 36. because of the high frequency of these particular haplotypes in bulgaria, italy, and turkey, it appears to be one of the more frequent defects in the pah gene causing classical phenylketonuria in this part of europe. the mutation is a g to a transition at position 546 in intron 10 of the pah gene, 11 bp upstream from the intron 10/exon 11 boundary. it activates a cryptic splice site and results in an in-frame insertion of 9 nucleotides between exon 10 and exon 11 of the processed mrna. normal amounts of liver pah protein are present in homozygous patients, but no catalytic activity can be detected. this loss of enzyme activity is probably caused by conformational changes resulting from the insertion of three additional amino acids (gly-leu-gln) between the normal sequences encoded by exon 10 and exon 11.	1

the conservative substitution asp-645-->glu in lysosomal alpha-glucosidase affects transport and phosphorylation of the enzyme in an adult patient with glycogen-storage disease type ii.  glycogen-storage disease type ii (gsdii) is caused by the deficiency of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). this paper reports on the analysis of the mutant alleles in an american black patient with an adult form of gsdii (gm1935). the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase precursor of this patient has abnormal molecular features: (i) the molecular mass is decreased, (ii) the phosphorylation is deficient and (iii) the proteolytic processing is impaired. sequence analysis revealed four mutations leading to amino acid alterations: asp-645-->glu, val-816-->ile, arg-854-->stop and thr-927-->ile. by using allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization on pcr-amplified cdna we have demonstrated that the arg-854-->stop mutation is located in one allele that is not expressed, and that the other allele contains the remaining three mutations. each of the mutations was introduced in wild-type cdna and expressed in cos cells to analyse the effect on biosynthesis, transport and phosphorylation of lysosomal alpha-glucosidase. the val-816-->ile substitution appeared to have no significant effect in contrast with results [martiniuk, mehler, bodkin, tzall, hirshhorn, zhong and hirschhorn (1991) dna cell biol. 10, 681-687] and was therefore defined as a polymorphism. the thr-927-->ile substitution deleting one of the seven glycosylation sites was found to be responsible for the decrease in molecular-mass, but not for the deficient proteolytic processing and phosphorylation. it did not cause the enzyme deficiency either. the third mutation leading to the asp-645-->glu substitution was proven to account in full for the observed defects in transport, phosphorylation and proteolytic processing of the newly synthesized alpha-glucosidase precursor of the patient.	1
a novel scn5a mutation associated with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation without typical ecg findings of brugada syndrome.  mutations in the human cardiac na+ channel alpha subunit gene (scn5a) are responsible for brugada syndrome, an idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (ivf) subgroup characterized by right bundle branch block and st elevation on an electrocardiogram (ecg). however, the molecular basis of ivf in subgroups lacking these ecg findings has not been elucidated. we performed genetic screenings of japanese ivf patients and found a novel scn5a missense mutation (s1710l) in one symptomatic ivf patient that did not exhibit the typical brugada ecg. heterologously expressed s1710l channels showed marked acceleration in the current decay together with a large hyperpolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation and depolarizing shift of activation. these findings suggest that scn5a is one of the responsible genes for ivf patients who do not show typical ecg manifestations of the brugada syndrome.	1
fh clinical phenotype in greek patients with ldl-r defective vs. negative mutations.  familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) is caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene and the gene encoding apolipoprotein b-100, affecting one in 500 individuals. one hundred and eighty-three greek fh patients were screened for mutations on the ldlr and apob genes. we identified mutations in 67 probands and 11 relatives. sixteen mutations located in eight different exons and the promoter of the ldlr were discovered. among them 10 were missense mutations (c6w, s265r, a370t, q363p, d365e, v408m, a410t, a517t, g528d, g571e), two were nonsense mutations (q363x and c660x), three were splice defects (2140 + 5g-->a and 2140 + 9c-->t, 1706 - 10g-->a), and one was a nucleotide substitution (- 45delt) on the promoter. none of the subjects carried any apob mutation. the detection rate of mutations in this study was 43%. from the above mutations, a410t, a519t and the splice site defects 2140 + 9c-->t were detected for the first time in the greek population. among them v408m, g528d, c6w and s265r account for 73% of heterozygous fh probands. v408m mutation is more common in central west, while c6w is more common in central east. separating the patients into two groups (receptor defective and receptor negative) we found that the receptor negative group had higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher prevalence of tendon xanthomas compared with the receptor-defective group. the homogenous molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolaemia in greece facilitates the application of a dna diagnostic strategy based on the origin of the patient. the early mutation analysis would add valuable information on the severity of the disease.	-1
skeletal muscle pathology of infantile pompe disease during long-term enzyme replacement therapy.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive metabolic neuromuscular disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). it has long been believed that the underlying pathology leading to tissue damage is caused by the enlargement and rupture of glycogen-filled lysosomes. recent studies have also implicated autophagy, an intracellular lysosome-dependent degradation system, in the disease pathogenesis. in this study, we characterize the long-term impact of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human gaa (rhgaa) on lysosomal glycogen accumulation and autophagy in some of the oldest survivors with classic infantile pompe disease (ipd). muscle biopsies from 8 [4 female, 4 male; 6 cross-reactive immunologic material (crim)-positive, 2 crim-negative] patients with a confirmed diagnosis of classic ipd were examined using standard histopathological approaches. in addition, muscle biopsies were evaluated by immunostaining for lysosomal marker (lysosomal-associated membrane protein-2; lamp2), autophagosomal marker (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; lc3), and acid and alkaline atpases. all patients received rhgaa by infusion at cumulative biweekly doses of 20-40 mg/kg. median age at diagnosis of classic ipd was 3.4 months (range: 0 to 6.5 months; n = 8). at the time of muscle biopsy, the patients' ages ranged from 1 to 103 months and ert duration ranged from 0 (i.e., baseline, pre-ert) to 96 months. the response to therapy varied considerably among the patients: some patients demonstrated motor gains while others experienced deterioration of motor function, either with or without a period of initial clinical benefit. skeletal muscle pathology included fiber destruction, lysosomal vacuolation, and autophagic abnormalities (i.e., buildup), particularly in fibers with minimal lysosomal enlargement. overall, the pathology reflected clinical status. this is the first study to investigate the impact of rhgaa ert on lysosomal glycogen accumulation and autophagic buildup in patients with classic ipd beyond 18 months of treatment. our findings indicate that ert does not fully halt or reverse the underlying skeletal muscle pathology in ipd. the best outcomes were observed in the two patients who began therapy early, namely at 0.5 and 1.1 months of age.	-1
does the aspartic acid to asparagine substitution at position 76 in the pancreas duodenum homeobox gene (pdx1) cause late-onset type 2 diabetes?  considerable data support an inherited defect in insulin secretion as one component of type 2 diabetes. coding variants of the pancreas duodenum homeobox gene (pdx1) were proposed to predispose late-onset type 2 diabetes and to decrease transactivation in vitro. we tested the hypothesis that the asp76asn (d76n) variant that was identified in several populations predisposed type 2 diabetes and reduced insulin secretion. we performed a case-control study in 191 control subjects and 190 individuals with type 2 diabetes, all of european descent, then characterized the d76n variant in 704 members of 68 families. we compared the phenotypic characteristics of those with and without the variant by diagnostic status and determined the insulin secretory response to intravenous glucose and tolbutamide among nondiabetic family members. d76n was not associated with type 2 diabetes, either in our population or when all reported studies in caucasians were combined. d76n did not segregate with diabetes among the families examined. among d76n carriers, nondiabetic individuals had a lower waist-to-hip ratio and a trend to lower bmi than their diabetic counterparts. diabetic carriers of d76n were significantly leaner by bmi (p = 0.012) and tended to be younger than diabetic individuals with the d/d genotype. however, insulin secretion in response to oral and intravenous glucose challenge and to intravenous tolbutamide was not reduced in d76n carriers. the d76n variant of pdx1 does not significantly alter insulin secretion or act as a high-risk susceptibility allele for late-onset type 2 diabetes as proposed previously, although we cannot exclude a minor role in increasing risk of diabetes.	-1
later-onset pompe disease: early detection and early treatment initiation enabled by newborn screening.  to determine whether newborn screening facilitates early detection and thereby early treatment initiation for later-onset pompe disease. we have conducted a newborn screening program since 2005. newborns with deficient skin fibroblast acid ?-glucosidase activity and two acid ?-glucosidase gene mutations but no cardiomyopathy were defined as having later-onset pompe disease, and their motor development and serum creatine kinase levels were monitored every 3 to 6 months. among 344 056 newborns, 13 (1 in 26 466) were found to have later-onset pompe disease. during a follow-up period of up to 4 years, four patients were treated because of hypotonia, muscle weakness, delayed developmental milestones/motor skills, or elevated creatine kinase levels starting at the ages of 1.5, 14, 34, and 36 months, respectively. muscle biopsy specimens obtained from the treated patients revealed increased storage of glycogen and lipids. newborn screening was found to facilitate the early detection of later-onset pompe disease. a subsequent symptomatic approach then identifies patients who need early treatment initiation.	-1
mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in iranian patients with phenylketonuria.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive disease which results from mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. the aim of this study was the identification of sixteen different mutations in iranian patients with hyperphenylalaninemia. the mutations were detected during the characterization of pah genotypes of 39 pku patients from qazvin and zanjan provinces of iran. pah mutations have been analyzed by pcr and direct sequencing of pcr products of the promoter region and all 13 exons of pah gene, including the splicing sites. a mutation detection rate of 74.3 % was realized. two mutations were found at high frequencies: r176x (10.25 %) and p.p281l (10.25 %). the frequencies of the other mutations were: ivs2+5g>a (2.56 %), ivs2+5g>c (2.56 %), p.l48s (2.56 %), p.r243q (2.56 %), p.r252q (5.12 %), p.r261q (7.69 %), p.r261x (5.12 %), p.e280k (2.56 %), p.i283n (2.56 %), ivs9+5g>a (2.56 %), ivs9+1g>a (1.28 %), ivs11+1g>c (1.28 %), p.c357r (1.28 %), c.632delc (2.56 %). the present results confirm the high heterogeneity of the pah locus and contribute to information about the distribution and frequency of pku mutations in the iranian population.	-1
"solution structure of the sixth ldl-a module of the ldl receptor.  the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) is the primary mechanism for uptake of plasma cholesterol into cells and serves as a prototype for an entire class of cell surface receptors. the amino-terminal domain of the receptor consists of seven ldl-a modules; the third through the seventh modules all contribute to the binding of low-density lipoproteins (ldls). here, we present the nmr solution structure of the sixth ldl-a module (lr6) from the ligand binding domain of the ldlr. this module, which has little recognizable secondary structure, retains the essential structural features observed in the crystal structure of ldl-a module five (lr5) of the ldlr. three disulfide bonds, a pair of buried residues forming a hydrophobic ""mini-core"", and a calcium-binding site that serves to organize the c-terminal lobe of the module all occupy positions in lr6 similar to those observed in lr5. the striking presence of a conserved patch of negative surface electrostatic potential among ldl-a modules of known structure suggests that ligand recognition by these repeats is likely to be mediated in part by electrostatic complementarity of receptor and ligand. two variants of lr6, identified originally as familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) mutations, have been investigated for their ability to form native disulfide bonds under conditions that permit disulfide exchange. the first, e219k, lies near the amino-terminal end of lr6, whereas the second, d245e, alters one of the aspartate side chains that directly coordinate the bound calcium ion. after equilibration at physiologic calcium concentrations, neither e219k nor d245e folds to a unique disulfide isomer, indicating that fh mutations both within and distant from the calcium-binding site give rise to protein-folding defects."	1
"genetic screening of mutations associated with fabry disease in a nationwide cohort of juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients.  fabry's disease (fd) is a lysosomal storage disorder associated with an alpha-galactosidase a deficiency. the prevalence of fd among juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) patients with established diagnosis is unknown, but as musculoskeletal pain may be an important complaint at presentation, misdiagnosed cases are anticipated. with this study, we aim to calculate the frequency of fd-associated mutations in a cohort of jia patients. children with jia from a national cohort were selected. clinical and laboratorial information was recorded in the portuguese rheumatic diseases register (http://reuma.pt). molecular genetic testing to detect gla gene mutations was performed. after the multiplex polymerase chain reactions technique for dna amplification, direct sequencing of the complete sequence ofgla gene was completed. from a cohort of 292 patients with jia (188 females, 104 males), mutations were identified in 5 patients (all female). four patients had the mutation d313y, a raregla variant, which is associated with low enzymatic levels in plasma, but normal lysosomal levels. one patient presented the missense mutation r118c, which was previously described in mediterranean patients with fd. this is the first screening of fd mutations in a cohort of jia patients. no ""classic"" pathogenic fd mutations were reported. the late-onset fd-associated mutation, r118c, was found in a frequency of 0.34% (1/292)."	-1
"functional and clinical consequences of novel ?-galactosidase a mutations in fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is a rare metabolic disorder of glycosphingolipid storage caused by mutations in the gla gene encoding lysosomal hydrolase ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a). recently, the diagnostic procedure for fd has advanced in several ways, through the development of a specific biomarker (lyso-gb3) and the implementation of newborn screenings, which acted as a catalyst to augment general awareness of the disease. heterologous over-expression of ?-gal a variants and subsequent in vitro measurement of enzyme activity provided molecular data to elucidate the relationship between mutation, enzyme damage, lyso-gb3 biomarker levels, and clinical phenotype. this knowledge is the foundation for improved counseling with regard to prognosis and therapeutic decisions. herein, we resume the approach of in vitro characterization, with a further 73 mainly novel gla gene mutations. patient lyso-gb3 data were available for most of the mutations. all mutations were tested for responsiveness to pharmacological chaperone treatment and phenotypic data for 61 hemizygous male and 116 heterozygous female patients carrying a mutation associated with ? 20% residual activity, formerly classified as ""mild"" variant, were collected in order to evaluate the pathogenicity. we conclude that a mild gla variant is typically characterized by high residual enzyme activity and normal biomarker levels. we found evidence that these variants can still be classified as a distinctive, but milder, sub-type of fd."	1
a phenylalanine hydroxylase amino acid polymorphism with implications for molecular diagnostics.  mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah, ec 1.14.16.1) are associated with various degrees of hyperphenylalaninemia, including classical phenylketonuria (pku). we examined the pah gene in a brazilian pku family of african origin and identified three missense variants, r252w (c.754c --> t), k274e (c.820a --> g), and i318t (c.953t --> c), the two latter of which were transmitted in cis. expression analyses in two different in vitro systems showed that i318t is associated with profoundly decreased enzyme activity, whereas the enzyme activity of k274e is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type protein. detailed kinetic analyses of pah expressed in e. coli showed that the k274e mutant protein has kinetic properties similar to that of the wild-type protein. population studies have suggested that the k274e variant occurs on approximately 4% of african-american pah alleles, whereas the neonatal screening incidence of pku among african americans is only 1:100,000. this is to our knowledge the first demonstration of a pah missense variant with no apparent association to pah deficiency. awareness of this common variant may be helpful to laboratories that perform molecular diagnosis of pah deficiency in populations of african origin.	1
microfluidic amplification as a tool for massive parallel sequencing of the familial hypercholesterolemia genes.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disorder that affects cholesterol metabolism and is an important risk factor for heart disease. three different genes were causally linked to this disorder: ldlr (low density lipoprotein receptor), apob [apolipoprotein b (including ag(x) antigen)], and pcsk9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9). we evaluated a new amplicon preparation tool for resequencing these genes on next generation sequencing (ngs) platforms. for the 3 genes, 38 primer pairs were designed and loaded on the fluidigm access array, a microfluidic array in which a pcr was performed. we amplified 144 dna samples (73 positive controls and 71 patient samples) and performed 3 sequencing runs on a gs flx titanium system from roche 454, using pyrosequencing. data were analyzed with the seqnext module of the sequence pilot software. from the 38 amplicons, 37 were amplified successfully, without any further optimization. sequencing resulted in a mean coverage of the individual amplicons of 71-fold, 74-fold, and 117-fold for the 3 runs, respectively. in the positive controls, all known mutations were identified. in 29% of the patient samples, a pathogenic point mutation or small deletion/insertion was found. large rearrangements were not detectable with ngs, but were picked up by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. combining a microfluidic amplification system with massive parallel sequencing is an effective method for mutation scanning in fh patients, which can be implemented in diagnostics. for data analysis, we propose a minimum variant frequency threshold of 20% and a minimum coverage of 25-fold.	-1
lkb1 interacts with and phosphorylates pten: a functional link between two proteins involved in cancer predisposing syndromes.  germline mutations of the lkb1 (stk11) tumor suppressor gene lead to peutz-jeghers syndrome (pjs) and predisposition to cancer. lkb1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase generally inactivated in pjs patients. we identified the dual phosphatase and tumor suppressor protein pten as an lkb1-interacting protein. several lkb1 point mutations associated with pjs disrupt the interaction with pten suggesting that the loss of this interaction might contribute to pjs. although pten and lkb1 are predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear, respectively, their interaction leads to a cytoplasmic relocalization of lkb1. in addition, we show that pten is a substrate of the kinase lkb1 in vitro. as pten is a dual phosphatase mutated in autosomal inherited disorders with phenotypes similar to those of pjs (bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome and cowden disease), our study suggests a functional link between the proteins involved in different hamartomatous polyposis syndromes and emphasizes the central role played by lkb1 as a tumor suppressor in the small intestine.	1
new gaa mutations in japanese patients with gsdii (pompe disease).  glycogen storage disease type ii (pompe disease) is inherited by autosomal recessive transmission and caused by a deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa), resulting in impaired degradation and lysosomal accumulation of glycogen. the gaa gene, responsible for this disease, has been mapped to chromosome 17q25.2-25.3. to date, more than 70 disease-causing mutations have been identified. in this study, we present four mutations found in three japanese patients with the juvenile form of glycogen storage disease type ii; three of these mutations were new (r224w, s619r, and r660h). the pathogenicity of these new mutations was verified by the loss of function of the mutant enzymes expressed in cos cells.	-1
comprehensive analysis of the beta-myosin heavy chain gene in 389 unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  we sought to determine the prevalence and phenotype of beta-myosin heavy chain gene myh7 mutations in a large cohort of unrelated patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm). hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous cardiac disease. myh7 mutations are one of the most common genetic causes of hcm and have been associated with severe hypertrophy, young age of diagnosis, and high risk of sudden cardiac death. however, these clinical findings from large, family studies have not been confirmed in a large unrelated cohort. deoxyribonucleic (dna) samples obtained from 389 hcm outpatients seen at this tertiary referral center were analyzed for mutations, using polymerase chain reaction, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, and dna sequencing for all 38 protein-coding exons of myh7. clinical data were extracted from patient records blinded to patient genotype. fifty-eight patients (15%) harbored 40 different mutations in myh7. compared with hcm patients without myh7 mutations, hcm patients with myh7 were younger at diagnosis (32.9 vs. 42.7 years, p = 0.0002), had more hypertrophy (left ventricular wall thickness of 24.2 vs. 21.1 mm, p = 0.0009), and more frequently underwent myectomy (60% vs. 38%, p = 0.002). the hcm patients with myh7 mutations more often had a family history of hcm (43% vs. 29%, p = 0.006), but there was no difference in family history of sudden death (16% vs. 14%, p = ns). in this setting, hcm patients with myh7 were diagnosed at a younger age and had more hypertrophy, but they had no greater frequency of sudden death among first-degree relatives. although these associations may prove useful for targeted gene screening, caution should be exercised in terms of using pathogenic status in risk stratification.	-1
development of a diagnostic genetic test for simplex and autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.  retinitis pigmentosa (rp) causes hereditary blindness in adults (prevalence, approximately 1 in 4000). each of the more than 30 causative genes identified to date are responsible for only a small percentage of cases. genetic diagnosis via traditional methods is problematic, and a single test with a higher probability of detecting the causative mutation would be very beneficial for the clinician. the goal of this study therefore was to develop a high-throughput screen capable of detecting both known mutations and novel mutations within all genes implicated in autosomal recessive or simplex rp. evaluation of diagnostic technology. participants were 56 simplex and autosomal recessive rp patients, with 360 population controls unscreened for ophthalmic disease. a custom genechip capable of resequencing all exons containing known mutations in 19 disease-associated genes was developed (rp genechip). a second, commercially available arrayed primer extension (apex) system was used to screen 501 individual previously reported variants. the ability of these high-throughput approaches to identify pathogenic variants was assessed in a cohort of simplex and autosomal recessive rp patients. number of mutations and potentially pathogenic variants identified. the rp genechip identified 44 sequence variants: 5 previously reported mutations; 22 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps); 11 novel, potentially pathogenic variants; and 6 novel snps. there was strong concordance with the apex array, but only the rp genechip detected novel variants. for example, identification of a novel mutation in crb1 revealed a patient, who also had a single previously known crb1 mutation, to be a compound heterozygote. in some individuals, potentially pathogenic variants were discovered in more than one gene, consistent with the existence of disease modifier effects resulting from mutations at a second locus. the rp genechip provides the significant advantage of detecting novel variants and could be expected to detect at least one pathogenic variant in more than 50% of patients. the apex array provides a reliable method to detect known pathogenic variants in autosomal recessive rp and simplex rp patients and is commercially available. high-throughput genotyping for rp is evolving into a clinically useful genetic diagnostic tool. the author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.	-1
intracellular retention is a common characteristic of childhood obesity-associated mc4r mutations.  heterozygous mutations in the coding region of the serpentine melanocortin 4 receptor are the most common genetic cause of human obesity described to date. there are still conflicting data regarding the overall prevalence of such mutations in obesity and limited information is available on the functional defects caused by most obesity-associated mc4r mutations. we report here the screening for mutations in the coding region of the mc4r of a new cohort of 172 patients presenting with severe childhood obesity and a family history of obesity. three heterozygous mc4r mutations (ser127leu, ala244glu and pro299his) were found in three patients of this cohort (1.74%), confirming that such mutations are implicated in a significant number of childhood obesity cases. a functional analysis of these mutant receptors, in addition to 11 other childhood obesity-associated mc4r mutations, indicates that they all alter the activation of the receptor by the endogenous agonist alpha-msh. to further examine the functional defects caused by childhood obesity-associated mc4r mutations, we developed a novel, sensitive technique to quantitatively analyze the effect of a mutation on mc4r cell surface expression. using this method we analyzed the cell surface expression of all the 14 described childhood obesity-associated mc4r missense mutations. we demonstrate that 81.3% of childhood obesity-associated heterozygous mc4r mutations lead to intracellular retention of the receptor. this result has implications for the potential pharmacologic rescue of childhood obesity-associated mc4r mutations and for the treatment of patients presenting with this condition.	1

functionally distinct groups of inherited pten mutations in autism and tumour syndromes.  germline mutations in the phosphatase pten are associated with diverse human pathologies, including tumour susceptibility, developmental abnormalities and autism, but any genotype-phenotype relationships are poorly understood. we have studied the functional consequences of seven pten mutations identified in patients diagnosed with autism and macrocephaly and five mutations from severe tumour bearing sufferers of pten hamartoma tumour syndrome (phts). all seven autism-associated pten mutants investigated retained the ability to suppress cellular akt signalling, although five were highly unstable. observed effects on akt also correlated with the ability to suppress soma size and the length and density of dendritic spines in primary neurons. conversely, all five pten mutations from severe cases of phts appeared to directly and strongly disrupt the ability to inhibit akt signalling. our work implies that alleles causing incomplete loss of pten function are more commonly linked to autism than to severe phts cases.	1
mutation identification of fabry disease in families with other lysosomal storage disorders.  fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder (lsd) caused by the deficiency of the enzyme ?-galactosidase. it exhibits a wide clinical spectrum that may lead to a delayed or even missed diagnosis and the real incidence can be underestimated. we report the cases of two unrelated italian families in whom fd was incidentally diagnosed in two females. in both families, the risk for other lysosomal disorders was known from other members affected by fucosidosis or mucopolysaccharidosis i hurler/scheie. some subjects were simultaneously heterozygous for fabry and the other lysosomal deficiency. our study shows that the risk for more than one lsds can occur in a family pedigree. the diagnosis of fabry in female probands represents a diagnostic challenge, as symptoms and signs can be variably present because of the random x-chromosome inactivation.	-1
costello syndrome h-ras alleles regulate cortical development.  genetic mutations in h-ras cause costello syndrome (cs), a complex developmental disorder associated with cortical abnormalities and profound mental retardation. here, we have asked whether there are perturbations in precursor cell proliferation, differentiation, or survival as a consequence of expressing cs h-ras alleles that could explain the cognitive deficits seen in this disorder. two different h-ras alleles encoding mutations present in cs patients, h-rasg12v and h-rasg12s were expressed in cortical progenitors in culture and in vivo by in utero electroporation and their effects on cortical precursor cell fate examined. expression of both mutants in cultured precursors inhibited neurogenesis and promoted proliferation and astrogenesis. in vivo, expression of either form of cs h-ras promoted cell proliferation and inhibited neurogenesis. moreover, these h-ras mutants promoted premature gliogenesis, causing formation of astrocytes at a time when normal gliogenesis has not yet begun, ultimately leading to an increase in the number of astrocytes postnatally. thus, aberrant h-ras activation enhances neural precursor cell proliferation, and perturbs the normal genesis of neurons and glial cells, effects that likely contribute to the cortical abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction seen in cs.	-1
de novo cdh1 mutation in a family presenting with early-onset diffuse gastric cancer.  in this report, we describe the first concluded case of a de novo germline mutation in cdh1 in a hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) kindred. the incident case was a woman with a personal history of hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse gastric cancer, who was then confirmed to have a cdh1 mutation (c.1792 c>t (r598x)). the patient's mother was found to have the same cdh1 germline mutation; however, neither maternal grandparent was found to carry the mutation, thus leading to a conclusion that the proband's mother's mutation is of de novo origin. this case highlights the importance of recognition of the hdgc syndrome and of testing for cdh1 germline mutations in young individuals with diffuse gastric cancer without a family history of the disease.	-1
sacral agenesis: a pilot whole exome sequencing and copy number study.  caudal regression syndrome (crs) or sacral agenesis is a rare congenital disorder characterized by a constellation of congenital caudal anomalies affecting the caudal spine and spinal cord, the hindgut, the urogenital system, and the lower limbs. crs is a complex condition, attributed to an abnormal development of the caudal mesoderm, likely caused by the effect of interacting genetic and environmental factors. a well-known risk factor is maternal type 1 diabetes. whole exome sequencing and copy number variation (cnv) analyses were conducted on 4 caucasian trios to identify de novo and inherited rare mutations. in this pilot study, exome sequencing and copy number variation (cnv) analyses implicate a number of candidate genes, including sptbn5, morn1, znf330, cltcl1 and pdzd2. de novo mutations were found in sptbn5, morn1 and znf330 and inherited predicted damaging mutations in pdzd2 (homozygous) and cltcl1 (compound heterozygous). importantly, predicted damaging mutations in pten (heterozygous), in its direct regulator gltscr2 (compound heterozygous) and in vangl1 (heterozygous) were identified. these genes had previously been linked with the crs phenotype. two cnv deletions, one de novo (chr3q13.13) and one homozygous (chr8p23.2), were detected in one of our crs patients. these deletions overlapped with cnvs previously reported in patients with similar phenotype. despite the genetic diversity and the complexity of the phenotype, this pilot study identified genetic features common across crs patients.	-1
targeted massively parallel sequencing of autism spectrum disorder-associated genes in a case control cohort reveals rare loss-of-function risk variants.  autism spectrum disorder (asd) is highly heritable, yet genome-wide association studies (gwas), copy number variation screens, and candidate gene association studies have found no single factor accounting for a large percentage of genetic risk. asd trio exome sequencing studies have revealed genes with recurrent de novo loss-of-function variants as strong risk factors, but there are relatively few recurrently affected genes while as many as 1000 genes are predicted to play a role. as such, it is critical to identify the remaining rare and low-frequency variants contributing to asd. we have utilized an approach of prioritization of genes by gwas and follow-up with massively parallel sequencing in a case-control cohort. using a previously reported asd noise reduction gwas analyses, we prioritized 837 refseq genes for custom targeting and sequencing. we sequenced the coding regions of those genes in 2071 asd cases and 904 controls of european white ancestry. we applied comprehensive annotation to identify single variants which could confer asd risk and also gene-based association analysis to identify sets of rare variants associated with asd. we identified a significant over-representation of rare loss-of-function variants in genes previously associated with asd, including a de novo premature stop variant in the well-established asd candidate gene rbfox1. furthermore, asd cases were more likely to have two damaging missense variants in candidate genes than controls. finally, gene-based rare variant association implicates genes functioning in excitatory neurotransmission and neurite outgrowth and guidance pathways including cacnad2, kcnh7, and nrxn1. we find suggestive evidence that rare variants in synaptic genes are associated with asd and that loss-of-function mutations in asd candidate genes are a major risk factor, and we implicate damaging mutations in glutamate signaling receptors and neuronal adhesion and guidance molecules. furthermore, the role of de novo mutations in asd remains to be fully investigated as we identified the first reported protein-truncating variant in rbfox1 in asd. overall, this work, combined with others in the field, suggests a convergence of genes and molecular pathways underlying asd etiology.	-1
effect of enzyme replacement therapy in late onset pompe disease: open pilot study of 48 weeks follow-up.  late-onset pompe disease (lopd) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme acid glucosidase alfa (gaa). recently, enzyme replacement therapy (ert) using recombinant human gaa (rhgaa) became clinically available, and is expected to modify the clinical course in lopd of various stages. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy and adverse events of ert for 48 weeks in korean lopd patients. five korean lopd patients were included in the study. at baseline, clinical and laboratory features, including muscular and pulmonary function, were assessed, and rhgaa was infused every 2 weeks. then, patients were examined at every 12-week interval for evaluation of changes in motor and pulmonary function for 48 weeks along with adverse reactions to ert. the muscular and pulmonary function of the patients varied depending on the baseline condition of the patient after 48 weeks of ert. however, the overall function of the patients showed stabilization of the disease rather than the improvement seen in infantile-onset pompe disease. this is the first clinical study on ert of korean lopd patients. results of our study showed stabilization of muscular and pulmonary function in lopd patients for 48 weeks with a favorable prognosis for patients who received early diagnosis and ambulatory patients. one of our patients developed a serious anaphylactic reaction, which necessitated the cessation of further ert. therefore, our study shows that early diagnosis and ert are important in preventing further deterioration of the disease.	-1
predicted effects of missense mutations on native-state stability account for phenotypic outcome in phenylketonuria, a paradigm of misfolding diseases.  phenylketonuria (pku) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in human phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). most missense mutations result in misfolding of pah, increased protein turnover, and a loss of enzymatic function. we studied the prediction of the energetic impact on pah native-state stability of 318 pku-associated missense mutations, using the protein-design algorithm foldx. for the 80 mutations for which expression analyses have been performed in eukaryote systems, in most cases we found substantial overall correlations between the mutational energetic impact and both in vitro residual activities and patient metabolic phenotype. this finding confirmed that the decrease in protein stability is the main molecular pathogenic mechanism in pku and the determinant for phenotypic outcome. metabolic phenotypes have been shown to be better predicted than in vitro residual activities, probably because of greater stringency in the phenotyping process. finally, all the remaining 238 pku missense mutations compiled at the pah locus knowledgebase (pahdb) were analyzed, and their phenotypic outcomes were predicted on the basis of the energetic impact provided by foldx. residues in exons 7-9 and in interdomain regions within the subunit appear to play an important structural role and constitute hotspots for destabilization. foldx analysis will be useful for predicting the phenotype associated with rare or new mutations detected in patients with pku. however, additional factors must be considered that may contribute to the patient phenotype, such as possible effects on catalysis and interindividual differences in physiological and metabolic processes.	1
molecular diagnosis of german patients with late-onset glycogen storage disease type ii.  in patients with late-onset glycogen storage disease type ii, one mutation, c.-32-13t>g, in the ?-glucosidase (gaa) gene is identified frequently in european populations from different regions along with many rarer mutations. we have performed molecular genetic investigations in 18 german index patients with late-onset disease. the c.-32-13t>g, c.525delt (p.glu176fsx45), and c.2481+102_2646+31del mutations were detected by pcr/restriction enzyme digest. other mutations were detected by sequencing. all patients were compound heterozygous and 17 patients harboured the c.-32-13t>g mutation. seven other previously described mutations (including the c.-32-13t>g) were identified, of which the p.c103g (c.307t>g) and the c.2481+102_2646+31del mutations were present each in three unrelated patients. sequencing revealed five novel mutations. genetic testing was able to identify the genetic defects in all patients and screening of the c.-32-13t>g mutation identified 94% of the cases. this is important for quick and reliable diagnosis, especially in view of enzyme replacement. among the rarer mutations, c.2481+102_2646+31del and p.c103g are rather frequent in germany.	-1
two novel mutations in acid ?-glucosidase gene in two patients with pompe disease.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder (gsd) caused by acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency. pompe disease has a broad genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. the infantile-onset form is the most severe form and presents with hypotonia and cardiomyopathy in early infancy. the probands who died were found to have gsd type ii based on clinical and biochemical findings. we report two families with pompe disease in whom the parents' molecular analysis revealed two novel mutations: c.2045a>g (p.q682r) and c.763c>t (p.q255x).	-1
prevalence of pathogenetic mc4r mutations in italian children with early onset obesity, tall stature and familial history of obesity.  melanocortin-4-receptor (mc4r) mutations represent the most frequent genetic cause of non-syndromic early onset obesity. children carrying mc4r mutations seem to show a particular phenotype characterized by early onset, severe obesity and high stature. to verify whether mc4r mutations are associated with this particular phenotype in the italian pediatric population, we decided to screen the mc4r gene in a group of obese children selected on the basis of their phenotype. to perform this study, a multicentric approach was designed. particularly, to be enrolled in the study subjects needed to meet the following criteria: body mass index > or = 3 deviation scores according to age and sex, familiar history of obesity (at least one parent obese), obesity onset before the 10 years old, height > or = 2 deviation scores. the coding region of mc4r gene was screened in 240 obese children (mean age 8.3 +/- 3.1, mean bmi 30.8 +/- 5.4) and in 200 controls (mean age 8.1 +/- 2.8; mean bmi 14.2 +/- 2.5). three mutations have been found in five obese children. the s127l (c380t), found in three unrelated children, had been described and functionally characterized previously. the q307x (c919t) and the y332h (t994c) mutations were found in two patients. functional studies showed that only q307x impaired protein function. the low prevalence of mc4r mutations (1.6%) in this group of obese children selected according to the obesity degree, the tall stature and the family history of obesity was similar to the prevalence observed in previous screenings performed in obese adults and in not phenotypically selected obese children.	-1
novel mutations widen the phenotypic spectrum of slow skeletal/?-cardiac myosin (myh7) distal myopathy.  laing early onset distal myopathy and myosin storage myopathy are caused by mutations of slow skeletal/?-cardiac myosin heavy chain encoded by the gene myh7, as is a common form of familial hypertrophic/dilated cardiomyopathy. the mechanisms by which different phenotypes are produced by mutations in myh7, even in the same region of the gene, are not known. to explore the clinical spectrum and pathobiology, we screened the myh7 gene in 88 patients from 21 previously unpublished families presenting with distal or generalized skeletal muscle weakness, with or without cardiac involvement. twelve novel mutations have been identified in thirteen families. in one of these families, the father of the proband was found to be a mosaic for the myh7 mutation. in eight cases, de novo mutation appeared to have occurred, which was proven in four. the presenting complaint was footdrop, sometimes leading to delayed walking or tripping, in members of 17 families (81%), with other presentations including cardiomyopathy in infancy, generalized floppiness, and scoliosis. cardiac involvement as well as skeletal muscle weakness was identified in nine of 21 families. spinal involvement such as scoliosis or rigidity was identified in 12 (57%). this report widens the clinical and pathological phenotypes, and the genetics of myh7 mutations leading to skeletal muscle diseases.	-1
mutation screening in dilated cardiomyopathy: prominent role of the beta myosin heavy chain gene.  familial dilated cardiomyopathy (fdcm) is associated with mutations in more than 10 genes, but genes mutation frequencies and associated clinical features remain largely unknown. here, we performed a mutation analysis of four genes involved in fdcm in a population of idiopathic dcm. a sscp and sequencing mutation screening of all the exons coding for beta myosin heavy chain (myh7 gene), cardiac t troponin (tnnt2 gene), phospholamban (pln gene), and the cardio-specific exon of metavinculin (vcl gene) were performed in 96 independent patients (54 familial and 42 sporadic). it led to the identification of eight heterozygous mutations, seven new ones in myh7, and the already described r141w mutation in tnnt2. myh7 mutations (in five familial and two sporadic cases) substitute residues located either in the head (i201t, t412n, a550v) or tail domains (t1019n, r1193s, e1426k, r1634s) of the protein. dcm was not associated with skeletal myopathy or conduction defects in any patients. contrasting clinical features were observed between myh7 and tnnt2 mutations carriers. in myh7 vs. tnnt2, mean age at diagnosis was late (p<0.03), penetrance was incomplete in adults (56 vs. 100%), and mean age at major cardiac event was higher (p<0.04). we have identified seven mutations in myh7, one in tnnt2, and none in pln or in the vcl cardio-specific exon. myh7 appears as the most frequently mutated gene in our fdcm population (approximately 10%), and mutation carriers present with delayed onset, in contrast to tnnt2.	-1
mutations in the pds gene in german families with pendred's syndrome: v138f is a founder mutation.  pendred's syndrome, an autosomal-recessive condition characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goiter, is caused by mutations in the pds gene. located on chromosome 7q22-q31, it encodes a chloride-iodide transporter expressed in the thyroid, inner ear, and kidney. we investigated the pds gene of six affected individuals from four unrelated families with pendred's syndrome by direct sequencing. pds mutations were identified in homozygous or compound heterozygous state in all six cases. a homozygous missense mutation leading to the amino acid substitution s133t was detected in a family of turkish origin. the mutations found in the other affected individuals, who originate from germany, were v138f/y530h, v138f/e384g, and v138f/v138f. because v138f was found in the german patients with pendred's syndrome on at least one allele, we genotyped five microsatellite markers located in the pds region. all affected german individuals shared a common haplotype at three microsatellite markers located close to or within the pds gene. we therefore concluded that v138f is a founder mutation in our cohort of german families with pendred's syndrome.	-1
early onset her2-positive breast cancer is associated with germline tp53 mutations.  germline tp53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associated with li-fraumeni syndrome. published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women with tp53 mutations is limited. we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who underwent genetic testing for suspected germline tp53 mutations and who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. the pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). patients who tested positive for germlinetp53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79). human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (p = .0001). among patients with a mutation, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (p = .87). after adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a her2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline tp53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). for each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a tp53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval0.91-0.99). this study suggests an association between germline tp53 mutations and early onset her2-positive breast cancer. if confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating her2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of the molecular pathways involved in breast cancer.	-1
mutational analysis of the gla gene in mexican families with fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is a lysosomal storage disorder, which develops due to a deficiency in the hydrolytic enzyme, ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a). alpha-gal a hydrolyzes glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (gb3), and an ?-gal a deficiency leads to gb3 accumulation in tissues and cells in the body. this pathology is likely to involve multiple systems, but it is generally considered to affect primarily vascular endothelium. in this study, we investigated mutations in the gla gene, which encodes ?-gal a, in mexican families with fd. we included seven probands with fd that carried known mutations. we analysed pedigrees of the probands, and performed molecular screening in 65 relatives with the potential of carrying a gla mutation. five mutations (p40s, ivs4+4, g328v, r363h, r404del) were detected in seven unrelated mexican families with the classic fd phenotype. of the 65 relatives examined, 42 (64.6%) had a gla gene mutation. in summary, among seven mexican probands with fd, 65 relatives were at risk of carrying a known gla mutation, and molecular screening identified 42 individuals with the mutation. thus, our findings showed that it is important to perform molecular analysis in families with fd to detect mutations and to provide accurate diagnoses for individuals that could be affected.	-1
mutational spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the population resident in catalonia: genotype-phenotype correlation.  hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) is a group of diseases characterized by the persistent elevation of phenylalanine levels in tissues and biological fluids. it is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting 1 in 10,000 individuals in caucasian populations and about 1 in 6,600 in catalonia. we report the mutational spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency in the population living in catalonia and the genotype-phenotype correlation. the molecular study was performed in 383 samples corresponding to 115 patients from 99 unrelated families and 268 relatives. we have characterized 90% of the mutant alleles; there were 57 different mutations, 49 of which have previously been described, 8 being novel mutations and two being large deletions. the 57 mutations detected corresponded to: five nonsense, seven frameshift, and eight splice defects, the remainder being missense mutations. these mutations cause 72 different genotypes in the 83 families characterized, confirming the mutational heterogeneity of phenylketonuria (pku) in the mediterranean population. according to our biochemical classification, our hpa population is composed of 40 pku (35%), 36 variant pku (31%), and 39 non-pku hpa (34%). mutations such as ivs 10, a403 v, and e390g correlated as expected with the phenotype and the predicted residual activity in vitro. however, in four cases (165 t, v388 m, r261q, and y414 c), the observed metabolic phenotype was not consistent with the predicted genotypic effect. the identification of the mutations in the pah gene and the genotype-phenotype correlation should facilitate the evaluation of metabolic phenotypes, diagnosis, implementation of optimal dietary therapy, and determination of prognosis in the patients and genetic counselling for the patient's relatives.	-1
a novel p53 germline alteration identified in a late onset breast cancer kindred.  germline mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the li-fraumeni syndrome, characterized by childhood sarcoma, leukemia and early onset breast cancer and has occasionally been found also in familial breast-ovarian cancer. most mutations found are of missense type and located in the central region of the gene (exons 5 to 8). in the present study, a germline p53 alteration was identified in a late onset breast cancer family (kindred lund 5; mean age 58 years) using single stranded conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. the mutation (a ccg to ctg transition) at codon 82 in exon 4, resulting in a proline to leucine substitution, has not previously been reported and was not present in a control set of 60 healthy individuals. three of five woman with breast cancer (45, 57 and 65 years) were carriers of the alteration. loss of heterozygosity at the p53 locus was not seen in the primary tumors of these women, but appeared as a partial loss of the wildtype allele in subsequent recurrent lesions of two gene carriers. the family manifested no linkage to the p53 gene (a two-point lod-score of -0.41), and has previously also been excluded for linkage to the brca1 and brca2 loci, as well as being carrier of a brca1 germline mutation. although it seems unlikely that the p53 germline mutation is the major cause of disease predisposition in lund 5, the data suggest that some p53 alteration may confer a subtle influence on breast cancer development and progression.	-1
functional and structural characterisation of 5 missense mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase.  phenylketonuria (pku) and hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) are a group of genetic disorders predominantly caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. to date, more than 950 variants have been identified, however the pathogenic mechanism of many variants remains unknown. in this study, in silico prediction and in vitro prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems were used to functionally characterize five pah missense variants (p.f233i, p.r270i, p.f331s, p.s350y, and p.l358f) previously identified in slovak and czech patients. p.f233i, p.r270i, and p.s350y were classified as deleterious mutations since they showed no specific activity in functional assay and no response to chaperone co-expression. protein levels of these pah variants were very low when expressed in hepg2 cells, and only p.s350y responded to bh4 precursor overload by significant increase in pah monomer, probably due to reduced rate of protein degradation as the result of proper protein folding. variants p.f331s and p.l358f exerted residual enzymatic activity in vitro. while the first can be classified as probably pathogenic due to its very low protein levels in hepg2 cells, the latter is considered to be mild mutation with protein levels of approximately 17.85% compared to wt pah. our findings contribute to better understanding of structure and function of pah mutated enzymes and optimal treatment of pku patients carrying these mutations using bh4 supplementation.	1
enzyme assay and clinical assessment in subjects with a chinese hotspot late-onset fabry mutation (ivs4 + 919g?a).  newborn screening for fabry disease in taiwan chinese has revealed a high incidence of the late-onset gla mutation ivs4 + 919g?a (?1 in 1,500-1,600 males). we studied 94 adults with this mutation [22 men, 72 women; mean age: men 57.8  6.0 (range 42-68), women 39.1  14.1 years (range 19-82)]. plasma ?-galactosidase a activity assay was 10.4  11.2% of normal in the men and 48.6  19.5% of normal in the women. echocardiography in 90 of the adults revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh) in 19 (21%), including 14 of 21 men (67%) and 5 of 69 women (7%). microalbuminuria, based on the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio measured on at least two occasions, was present in 17 of 86 subjects (20%) (men: 5/20, 25%; women 12/66, 18%). at least one ocular manifestation consistent with fabry disease was present in 41 of 52 subjects (79%) who underwent ophthalmologic examination, including 8 (15%) with conjunctival vessel tortuosity, 15 (29%) with cornea verticillata, 10 (19%) with fabry cataract, and 34 (65%) with retinal vessel tortuosity. among subjects over 40 years of age, men were more likely than women to have lvh [14/21 (67%) vs 5/25 (20%), p < 0.001]. cardiovascular, renal and ocular abnormalities are highly prevalent in adult taiwan chinese subjects with the fabry mutation ivs4 + 919g?a. our findings contribute to the limited understanding of the course of this late-onset disease variant and underscore the need for close follow up in such patients.	-1
clinical and gaa gene mutation analysis in mainland chinese patients with late-onset pompe disease: identifying c.2238g > c as the most common mutation.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal glycogen storage disorder that has been reported in different ethnic populations which carry different common mutations of the acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene. the gaa mutation pattern in mainland chinese patients with late-onset pompe disease is still not well understood. we presented the clinical and genetic characteristics of 27 mainland chinese late-onset pompe patients from 24 families. gaa mutation analysis revealed 26 different mutations, including 10 that were novel. the allelic frequency of c.2238g > c (p.w746c) was found to be 27.08% in this patient group. respiratory dysfunction was diagnosed in 10 of 11 patients who underwent pulmonary function evaluation, although only four required ventilator support at night. our findings indicate that c.2238g > c (p.w746c) is the most common mutation in mainland chinese late-onset pompe patients, as observed in taiwanese patients. the novel mutations identified in this study expand the genetic spectrum of late-onset pompe disease, and the prevalence of respiratory dysfunction highlights the importance of monitoring pulmonary function in late-onset pompe patients.	-1
the importance of e-cadherin binding partners to evaluate the pathogenicity of e-cadherin missense mutations associated to hdgc.  in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc), cdh1 germline gene alterations are causative events in 30% of the cases. in 20% of hdgc families, cdh1 germline mutations are of the missense type and the mutation carriers constitute a problem in terms of genetic counseling and surveillance. to access the pathogenic relevance of missense mutations, we have previously developed an in vitro method to functionally characterize them. pathogenic e-cadherin missense mutants fail to aggregate and become more invasive, in comparison with cells expressing the wild-type (wt) protein. herein, our aim was to develop a complementary method to unravel the pathogenic significance of e-cadherin missense mutations. we used cells stably expressing wt e-cadherin and seven hdgc-associated mutations (five intracellular and two extracellular) and studied by proximity ligation assays (pla) how these mutants bind to fundamental regulators of e-cadherin function and trafficking. we focused our attention on the interaction with: p120, ?-catenin, pipki? and hakai. we showed that cytoplasmic e-cadherin mutations affect the interaction of one or more binding partners, compromising the e-cadherin stability at the plasma membrane and likely affecting the adhesion complex competence. in the present work, we demonstrated that the study of the interplay between e-cadherin and its binding partners, using pla, is an easy, rapid, quantitative and highly reproducible technique that can be applied in routine labs to verify the pathogenicity of e-cadherin missense mutants for hdgc diagnosis, especially those located in the intracellular domain of the protein.	1
application of whole-exome sequencing to direct the specific functional testing and diagnosis of rare inherited bleeding disorders in patients from the resund region, scandinavia.  rare inherited bleeding disorders (ibd) are a common cause of bleeding tendency. to ensure a correct diagnosis, specialized laboratory analyses are necessary. this study reports the results of an upfront diagnostic strategy using targeted whole exome sequencing. in total, 156 patients with a significant bleeding assessment tool score participated in the study, of which a third had thrombocytopenia. eighty-seven genes specifically associated with genetic predisposition to bleeding were analysed by whole exome sequencing. variants were classified according to the five-tier scheme. we identified 353 germline variants. eight patients (5%) harboured a known pathogenic variant. of the 345 previously unknown variants, computational analyses predicted 99 to be significant. further filtration according to the mendelian inheritance pattern, resulted in 59 variants being predicted to be clinically significant. moreover, 34% (20/59) were assigned as novel class 4 or 5 variants upon targeted functional testing. a class 4 or 5 variant was identified in 30% of patients with thrombocytopenia (14/47) versus 11% of patients with a normal platelet count (12/109) (p < 001). an ibd diagnosis has a major clinical impact. the genetic investigations detailed here extricated our patients from a diagnostic conundrum, thus demonstrating that continuous optimization of the diagnostic work-up of ibd is of great benefit.	-1
germline cdh1 mutations in bilateral lobular carcinoma in situ.  invasive lobular breast cancer (ilc) and lobular carcinoma in situ (lcis) are characterised by loss of e-cadherin expression. however germline cdh1 mutations are rare in cases of ilc with no family history of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) and have not been described in women with lcis. we screened the cdh1 gene in 50 cases of bilateral lcis/ilc using sanger sequencing and mlpa. sanger sequencing revealed four pathogenic germline mutations, including a novel splicing mutation (c.48+1g>a). the remaining three (c.1465insc, c.1942g>t, c.2398delc) have been previously described. all four cases had bilateral lcis +/- ilc and no family history of gastric cancer. cdh1 germline mutations have not been previously described in women with lcis. we have shown that germline cdh1 mutations are associated with early onset of bilateral lcis with or without ilc in women without a family history of gastric cancer. cdh1 mutation screening should be considered in women with early onset of bilateral lcis/ilc with no family history of hdgc.	-1
targeted next-generation sequencing for the molecular genetic diagnostics of cardiomyopathies.  today, mutations in more than 30 different genes have been found to cause inherited cardiomyopathies, some associated with very poor prognosis. however, because of the genetic heterogeneity and limitations in throughput and scalability of current diagnostic tools up until now, it is hardly possible to genetically characterize patients with cardiomyopathy in a fast, comprehensive, and cost-efficient manner. we established an array-based subgenomic enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing to detect mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm). with this approach, we show that the genomic region of interest can be enriched by a mean factor of 2169 compared with the coverage of the whole genome, resulting in high sequence coverage of selected disease genes and allowing us to define the genetic pathogenesis of cardiomyopathies in a single sequencing run. in 6 patients, we detected disease-causing mutations, 2 microdeletions, and 4 point mutations. furthermore, we identified several novel nonsynonymous variants, which are predicted to be harmful, and hence, might be potential disease mutations or modifiers for dcm or hcm. the approach presented here allows for the first time a comprehensive genetic screening in patients with hereditary dcm or hcm in a fast and cost-efficient manner.	-1
germline pten mutations are rare and highly penetrant.  cowden syndrome (multiple hamartoma syndrome, mim 158350) is an early onset syndrome characterized by multiple hamartomas in the skin, mucous membranes, breast, thyroid and endometrium. patients with cowden syndrome have increased risk of breast cancer, thyroid cancer and endometrial cancer. in 1997 germline mutations in pten were demonstrated to cause cowden syndrome. we report the results of diagnostic and predictive testing in all families with cowden syndrome or suspected cowden syndrome registered at the norwegian cancer family clinics. pten mutations were found in all six families meeting the clinical criteria for cowden syndrome, in none of the two families assumed to have cowden syndrome but not fulfilling the criteria, and in none of the eight families selected in our computerized medical files to have a combination of breast and thyroid cancers. age-related penetrances for the various neoplasms are given. all families but one were small and de novo mutations were found.	-1
prioritizing variants in complete hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes in patients lacking known brca mutations.  brca1 and brca2 testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (hboc) does not identify all pathogenic variants. sequencing of 20 complete genes in hboc patients with uninformative test results (n = 287), including noncoding and flanking sequences of atm, bard1, brca1, brca2, cdh1, chek2, epcam, mlh1, mre11a, msh2, msh6, mutyh, nbn, palb2, pms2, pten, rad51b, stk11, tp53, and xrcc2, identified 38,372 unique variants. we apply information theory (it) to predict and prioritize noncoding variants of uncertain significance in regulatory, coding, and intronic regions based on changes in binding sites in these genes. besides mrna splicing, it provides a common framework to evaluate potential affinity changes in transcription factor (tfbss), splicing regulatory (srbss), and rna-binding protein (rbbss) binding sites following mutation. we prioritized variants affecting the strengths of 10 splice sites (four natural, six cryptic), 148 srbs, 36 tfbs, and 31 rbbs. three variants were also prioritized based on their predicted effects on mrna secondary (2) structure and 17 for pseudoexon activation. additionally, four frameshift, two in-frame deletions, and five stop-gain mutations were identified. when combined with pedigree information, complete gene sequence analysis can focus attention on a limited set of variants in a wide spectrum of functional mutation types for downstream functional and co-segregation analysis.	-1
spectrum of mutations of the lpl gene identified in italy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia.  monogenic hypertriglyceridemia (htg) may result from mutations in some genes which impair the intravascular lipolysis of triglyceride (tg)-rich lipoproteins mediated by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase (lpl). mutations in the lpl gene are the most frequent cause of monogenic htg (familial chylomicronemia) with recessive transmission. the lpl gene was resequenced in 149 patients with severe htg (tg > 10 mmol/l) and 106 patients with moderate htg (tg > 4.5 and <10 mmol/l) referred to tertiary lipid clinics in italy. in the group of severe htg, 26 patients (17.4%) were homozygotes, 9 patients (6%) were compound heterozygotes and 15 patients (10%) were simple heterozygotes for rare lpl gene variants. single or multiple episodes of pancreatitis were recorded in 24 (48%) of these patients. there was no difference in plasma tg concentration between patients with or without a positive history of pancreatitis. among moderate htg patients, six patients (5.6%) were heterozygotes for rare lpl variants; two of them had suffered from pancreatitis. overall 36 rare lpl variants were found, 15 of which not reported previously. systematic analysis of close relatives of mutation carriers led to the identification of 44 simple heterozygotes (plasma tg 3.2  4.1 mmol/l), none of whom had a positive history of pancreatitis. the prevalence of rare lpl variants in patients with severe or moderate htg, referred to tertiary lipid clinics, was 50/149 (33.5%) and 6/106 (5.6%), respectively. systematic analysis of relatives of mutation carriers is an efficient way to identify heterozygotes who may develop severe htg.	-1
gain-of-function raf1 mutations cause noonan and leopard syndromes with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  noonan and leopard syndromes are developmental disorders with overlapping features, including cardiac abnormalities, short stature and facial dysmorphia. increased ras signaling owing to ptpn11, sos1 and kras mutations causes approximately 60% of noonan syndrome cases, and ptpn11 mutations cause 90% of leopard syndrome cases. here, we report that 18 of 231 individuals with noonan syndrome without known mutations (corresponding to 3% of all affected individuals) and two of six individuals with leopard syndrome without ptpn11 mutations have missense mutations in raf1, which encodes a serine-threonine kinase that activates mek1 and mek2. most mutations altered a motif flanking ser259, a residue critical for autoinhibition of raf1 through 14-3-3 binding. of 19 subjects with a raf1 mutation in two hotspots, 18 (or 95%) showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm), compared with the 18% prevalence of hcm among individuals with noonan syndrome in general. ectopically expressed raf1 mutants from the two hcm hotspots had increased kinase activity and enhanced erk activation, whereas non-hcm-associated mutants were kinase impaired. our findings further implicate increased ras signaling in pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.	1

mutations in the human genes encoding the transcription factors of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)1 and hnf4 families: functional and pathological consequences.  mutations in the human genes encoding the tissue-specific transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)1alpha, hnf1beta and hnf4alpha are responsible for maturity onset diabetes of the young (mody), a monogenic dominant inherited form of diabetes mellitus characterized by defective insulin secretion of the pancreatic beta-cells. in addition, the mutated hnf1beta gene causes defective development of the kidney and genital malformation. this review summarizes the main features of these transcription factors and discusses potential events leading to the specific disease phenotypes.	-1
the pathological effects of connexin 26 variants related to hearing loss by in silico and in vitro analysis.  gap junctions (gjs) are intercellular channels associated with cell-cell communication. connexin 26 (cx26) encoded by the gjb2 gene forms gjs of the inner ear, and mutations of gjb2 cause congenital hearing loss that can be syndromic or non-syndromic. it is difficult to predict pathogenic effects using only genetic analysis. using ionic and biochemical coupling tests, we evaluated the pathogenic effects of cx26 variants using computational analyses to predict structural abnormalities. for seven out of ten variants, we predicted the variation would result in a loss of gj function, whereas the others would completely fail to form gjs. functional studies demonstrated that, although all variants were able to function normally as hetero-oligomeric gj channels, six variants (p.e47k, p.e47q, p.h100l, p.h100y, p.r127l, and p.m195l) did not function normally as homo-oligomeric gj channels. interestingly, gjs composed of the cx26 variant p.r127h were able to function normally, even as homo-oligomeric gj channels. this study demonstrates the particular location and property of an amino acid are more important mainly than the domain where they belong in the formation and function of gj, and will provide information that is useful for the accurate diagnosis of hearing loss.	1
somatic myh7, mybpc3, tpm1, tnnt2 and tnni3 mutations in sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a clinically heterogeneous genetic heart disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of another disease that could explain the wall thickening. elucidation of the genetic basis of hcm lead to the identification of several genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, such as myh7, mybpc3, tpm1, tnnt2, and tnni3. sarcomeric genes are mutated in approximately 40% of hcm patients and a possible explanation for the incomplete yield of mutation-positive hcm may be somatic mutations. we studied 104 unrelated patients with non-familial hcm. patients underwent clinical evaluation and mutation screening of 5 genes implicated in hcm (myh7, mybpc3, tpm1, tnnt2, and tnni3) in genomic dna isolated from resected cardiac tissue; 41 of 104 were found to carry a mutation, but as several patients carried the same mutations, the total amount of different mutations was 37; 20 of these mutations have been previously described, and pathogenicity has been assessed. to determine the effect of the 17 new mutations an in silico assay was performed and it predicted that 4 variants were damaging mutations. all identified variants were also seen in the dna isolated from the corresponding blood, which demonstrated the absence of somatic mutations. somatic mutations in myh7, mybpc3, tpm1, tnnt2, and tnni3 do not represent an important etiologic pathway in hcm.	-1

mutation analysis in costello syndrome: functional and structural characterization of the hras p.lys117arg mutation.  costello syndrome is a mental retardation syndrome characterized by high birth weight, postnatal growth retardation, coarse face, loose skin, cardiovascular problems, and tumor predisposition. de novo heterozygous missense mutations in hras codon 12 and 13 disturbing the intrinsic gtp hydrolysis cause costello syndrome. we report a patient with typical costello syndrome and a novel heterozygous missense mutation in codon 117 (c.350a>g, p.lys117arg) of the hras gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the ras/mapk pathway similar to the typical p.gly12ser and p.gly12ala mutations. recombinant hras p.lys117arg demonstrates normal intrinsic gtp hydrolysis and responsiveness to gtpase-activating proteins, but the nucleotide dissociation rate is increased 80-fold. consistent with the biochemical data, the crystal structure of the p.lys117arg mutant indicates an altered interaction pattern of the side chain that is associated with unfavorable nucleotide binding properties. together, these data show that a ras mutation that only perturbs guanine nucleotide binding has similar functional consequences as mutations that impair gtp hydrolysis and causes human disease.	1
astrocytomas and choroid plexus tumors in two families with identical p53 germline mutations.  germline p53 mutations carry an increased risk of development of breast cancer, soft tissue and osteosarcomas, brain tumors, leukemia and adrenocortical carcinomas. cerebral neoplasms are usually of astrocytic lineage and occur in 40% of affected families. this report presents clinical, neuropathological and molecular genetic data from 2 families in france with an identical p53 germline mutation in codon 248 (cgg->tgg; arg->trp) and a clustering of cns tumors. the youngest patient in each family developed a malignant choroid plexus tumor while several young adults of both kindred succumbed to low-grade astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma. the only non-neural neoplasm was an adrenocortical carcinoma in a boy aged 4 years who developed an anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma 2 years later. of 2 previously reported inherited choroid plexus tumors, 1 occurred in a family which also carried a germline mutation in codon 248. it remains to be shown whether this unusual pattern of cns tumors is due to an organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or whether it reflects the genetic background of the affected families.	-1
the relationship of molecular genetic to clinical diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in a danish population.  the genes encoding the ldl receptor and apob were screened for mutations associated with familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) in 408 patients referred to the lipid clinic in 1995-2003. the study aimed at testing the ability of three different sets of clinical criteria to predict the results of molecular genetic analysis, and secondly test whether population-based age- and sex-specific percentiles of ldl-cholesterol offer useful supplemental information in the selection of patients for molecular genetic analysis. the patients were retrospectively categorised according to simon broome register group criteria, make early diagnosis to prevent early death criteria (medped) and the dutch lipid clinic network criteria, and the distribution of patients was compared to the results of the molecular genetic analysis. the study illustrates a classical dilemma. mutation detection rates (and specificities) are high only if sensitivity is very low and vice versa: to find most mutation carriers, even patients with only possible fh must be examined by molecular genetic testing leading to mutation detection rates as low as 30-40%.	-1
"e-cadherin gene mutations in human gastric carcinoma cell lines.  reduced expression of e-cadherin has been regarded as one of the main molecular events involved in dysfunction of the cell-cell adhesion system, triggering cancer invasion and metastasis. however, even with a sufficient amount of e-cadherin, cell-cell adhesion is sometimes lost in ""diffusely invasive"" human carcinomas. ten human cancer cell lines, showing growth characterized morphologically by loose cell-cell adhesion, were analyzed for possible structural abnormalities of their expressed e-cadherin. four of the cell lines showed strong mrna and protein expression with no nucleotide sequence abnormalities, and mrna was absent in four other cell lines. mrna sequence was abnormal in the remaining two gastric carcinoma cell lines. in mkn45 (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma), this involved a 12-bp in-frame deletion with strong expression of mrna and protein. in kato-iii (signet ring cell carcinoma), there were four mrna species with insertions of different sizes, among which the major transcripts (with a 7-bp insertion) caused a frameshift, and expression of both mrna and protein was markedly reduced. in these two cell lines, dna mutations were detected around exon-intron junctions, revealing that aberrant rna splicing was the cause of the mrna abnormalities. in addition, the wild-type allele of the e-cadherin locus was lost, suggesting that the e-cadherin gene had been inactivated by two hits (mutation and allele loss), similar to the mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes."	1
mutation spectrum of the connexin 26 (gjb2) gene in taiwanese patients with prelingual deafness.  to determine the mutation spectrum of the connexin 26 gene among 324 taiwanese patients with prelingual deafness and the carrier rate of gene mutation in another 432 unrelated control subjects. the coding region of the connexin 26 gene was sequenced in both directions to detect mutation in all 756 samples. among the 756 samples tested, 21 connexin 26 variants were detected, including 7 novel ones. the 235delc mutation was the most common, accounting for 57.6% of the mutant alleles. among patients, 48 (14.8%) had connexin 26 gene mutations. in the control group, the carrier rate of connexin 26 mutation was estimated at 2.8%. the mutation spectrum of the connexin 26 gene is wide, with more than half of the patients having only one mutation detected. thus, further efforts are needed to look for possible existence of a second mutant allele.	-1
carrier frequency of gjb2 (connexin-26) mutations causing inherited deafness in the korean population.  mutations in the gjb2 gene are associated with hereditary hearing loss. although most studies of gjb2 mutations have dealt with hearing-impaired patients, there are few reports of the frequency of these mutations in the general population. the purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of gjb2 mutations causing inherited deafness in the general korean population. blood samples were obtained from 2,072 newborns with normal hearing. the dried blood samples were subjected to pcr to amplify the entire coding region of the gjb2 gene, which was followed by direct dna sequencing. a total of 24 different sequence variants were identified in the coding region of gjb2, including eight pathogenic mutations (p.v37i, p.g45e, p.r143 w, c.176_191del16, c.235delc, c.292_298dup7, c.299_300delat and c.605ins46), four polymorphisms (p.v27i, p.e114g, p.g160s and p.i203t), six unclassified variants (p.g4d, p.s85y, p.t123 n, p.r127h, p.a171t and p.f191l) and six novel variants (p.w3t, p.i20l, p.k41e, c.147c > t, c.186c > t and c.576a > g). pathogenic mutations causing inherited deafness were identified in 3% (62/2,072) of the newborns with normal hearing. of the eight pathogenic mutations found, p.v37i was the most common (1.35%, 28/2,072), followed by c.235delc (1.25%, 26/2,072). these data provide information about carrier frequency for gjb2-based hearing loss and have important implications for genetic diagnostic testing for inherited deafness in the korean population.	-1
frequency and phenotypic spectrum of germline mutations in pole and seven other polymerase genes in 266 patients with colorectal adenomas and carcinomas.  in a number of families with colorectal adenomatous polyposis or suspected lynch syndrome/hnpcc, no germline alteration in the apc, mutyh, or mismatch repair (mmr) genes are found. missense mutations in the polymerase genes pole and pold1 have recently been identified as rare cause of multiple colorectal adenomas and carcinomas, a condition termed polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis (ppap). the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical relevance and phenotypic spectrum of polymerase germline mutations. therefore, targeted sequencing of the polymerase genes pold1, pold2, pold3, pold4, pole, pole2, pole3 and pole4 was performed in 266 unrelated patients with polyposis or fulfilled amsterdam criteria. the pole mutation c.1270c>g;p.leu424val was detected in four unrelated patients. the mutation was present in 1.5% (4/266) of all patients, 4% (3/77) of all familial cases and 7% (2/30) of familial polyposis cases. the colorectal phenotype in 14 affected individuals ranged from typical adenomatous polyposis to a hnpcc phenotype, with high intrafamilial variability. multiple colorectal carcinomas and duodenal adenomas were common, and one case of duodenal carcinoma was reported. additionally, various extraintestinal lesions were evident. nine further putative pathogenic variants were identified. the most promising was c.1306c>t;p.pro436ser in pole. in conclusion, a ppap was identified in a substantial number of polyposis and familial colorectal cancer patients. screening for polymerase proofreading mutations should therefore be considered, particularly in unexplained familial cases. the present study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of ppap to duodenal adenomas and carcinomas, and identified novel, potentially pathogenic variants in four polymerase genes.	-1
juvenile-onset glycogen storage disease type ii with novel mutations in acid alpha-glucosidase gene.  the authors describe two novel mutations of the acid alpha-glucosidase gene, p361l and r437c, which define the juvenile-onset glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) in a 16-year-old chinese patient. the asymptomatic 13-year-old brother of the proband is also a compound heterozygote of the two mutations. these results confirm that intrafamilial phenotypic variation of juvenile-onset gsdii is ethnically diverse and suggest the contribution of other genes to the phenotypic variability of gsdii.	1
autophagy in natural history and after ert in glycogenosis type ii.  we studied the role of autophagy in a series of 10 infantile-, juvenile-, and adult-onset gsdii patients and investigated autophagy blockade in successive biopsies of adult cases during disease natural history. we also correlated the autophagosome accumulation and efficiency of enzyme replacement therapy (ert) in four treated cases (two infantile and two juvenile-adult onsets).the autophagic flux was monitored by measuring the amount of p62-positive protein aggregates and compared, together with fibre vacuolisation, to fibre atrophy.a blocked autophagic flux resulted in p62 accumulation, increased vacuolisation, and progressive atrophy of muscle fibres in biopsies collected from patients during natural history. on the contrary, in the gsdii cases early treated with ert, the autophagic flux improved and muscle fibre atrophy, fibre vacuolisation, and acid phosphatase activity decreased.the functionality of the autophagy-lysosome system is essential in gsdii muscle, which is characterised by the presence of swollen glycogen-filled lysosomes and autophagic build-up. defining the role of autophagy and its relationship with muscle loss is critical for understanding the disease pathogenesis, for developing new therapies, and for improving ert efficacy in gsdii.	-1

variability in assigning pathogenicity to incidental findings: insights from ldlr sequence linked to the electronic health record in 1013 individuals.  knowledge of variant pathogenicity is key to implementing genomic medicine. we describe variability between expert reviewers in assigning pathogenicity to sequence variants in ldlr, the causal gene in the majority of cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. ldlr was sequenced on the illumina hiseq platform (average read depth >200  ) in 1013 mayo biobank participants recruited from 2012 to 2013. variants with a minor allele frequency (maf) <5% predicted to be functional or referenced in hgmd (human gene mutation database) or ncbi-clinvar databases were reviewed. to assign pathogenicity, variant frequency in population data sets, computational predictions, reported observations and patient-level data including electronic health record-based post hoc phenotyping were leveraged. of 178 ldlr variants passing quality control, 25 were selected for independent review using either an in-house protocol or a disease/gene-specific semi-quantitative framework based on the american college of medical genetics and genomics-recommended lines of evidence. ncbi-clinvar included interpretations for all queried variants with 74% (14/19) of variants with >1 submitter showing inconsistency in classification and 26% (5/19) appearing with conflicting clinical actionability. the discordance rate (one-step level of disagreement out of five classes in variant interpretation) between the reviewers was 40% (10/25). two ldlr variants were independently deemed clinically actionable and returnable. interpretation of ldlr variants was often discordant among clinvar submitters and between expert reviewers. a quantitative approach based on strength of each predefined criterion in the context of specific genes and phenotypes may yield greater consistency between different reviewers.	-1
de novo loss- or gain-of-function mutations in kcna2 cause epileptic encephalopathy.  epileptic encephalopathies are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of severe epilepsies accompanied by intellectual disability and other neurodevelopmental features. using next-generation sequencing, we identified four different de novo mutations in kcna2, encoding the potassium channel kv1.2, in six isolated patients with epileptic encephalopathy (one mutation recurred three times independently). four individuals presented with febrile and multiple afebrile, often focal seizure types, multifocal epileptiform discharges strongly activated by sleep, mild to moderate intellectual disability, delayed speech development and sometimes ataxia. functional studies of the two mutations associated with this phenotype showed almost complete loss of function with a dominant-negative effect. two further individuals presented with a different and more severe epileptic encephalopathy phenotype. they carried mutations inducing a drastic gain-of-function effect leading to permanently open channels. these results establish kcna2 as a new gene involved in human neurodevelopmental disorders through two different mechanisms, predicting either hyperexcitability or electrical silencing of kv1.2-expressing neurons.	-1
[genetic diagnosis of phenylketonuria: identification of the mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene by pcr direct sequencing].  to investigate the mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene in orientals, direct sequencing was conducted on dna fragments amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, using solid phase technology involving the biotin-streptavidin system. four mutations possibly associated with phenylketonuria (pku) were identified in a chinese and four japanese patients. a novel arg158 (cgg)-to-trp158 (tgg) mutation was identified in exon 5 of the pah gene in a chinese pku patient. the second change was due to a g-to-a transversion at the last base of intron 4. the third change was a compound heterozygote; one mutation was a g-to-a transversion at the last base of intron 4. the other was a g-to-c transversion at the second base of codon 413, which resulted in a substitution of arg(cgc) by pro(ccc) in exon 12. the last change was due to a tyr204(tat) -to-cys204(tgt) mutation in exon 6 of the pah gene in two japanese. this preliminary study revealed a novel pku mutation and considerable genetic heterogeneity in the pah gene among orientals.	-1

complex functions of mutant p53 alleles from human prostate cancer.  few studies have used multiple assays to examine the functionality of mutant p53 in prostate cancer (cap). we employed seven functional assays to study 16 representative mutant p53 alleles, six from localized and ten from metastatic cap. yeast assays were employed to determine loss of function (lof), partial function (pf), and dominant-negative status. assays using p53-null saos2 cells were used to determine whether mammalian cells transfected with mutant p53 could up-regulate the mdr-1 or pcna promoters, alter il-6 expression or confer the ability to grow in soft agar. as a further test of gain of function (gof), p53-null pc3 cells stably transfected with these mutant p53 alleles were examined for cell cycle distributions. all 16 mutant p53 alleles demonstrated either total or partial lof. all but one allele also had at least one gain of function; however, the pattern of gof was different for each mutant allele. alleles derived from both localized and metastatic cap had similar gof characteristics; however, only alleles from metastatic disease had significantly increased s-phase fractions. different mutant p53 alleles from cap had different, complex functional profiles. the lack of predictable patterns for these alleles suggest that each mutation may uniquely affect p53 function.	1
the spectrum of pah mutations and increase of milder forms of phenylketonuria in sweden during 1965-2014.  newborn screening (nbs) for phenylketonuria (pku) which has a continuum of disease severities has been performed for more than 50 years. the screening method has undergone a continuous development with not only improvements of the positive predictive value but also identification of milder forms of the disease. with the introduction of genetic testing the confirmation of the diagnosis has improved. the swedish nbs is centralized to one laboratory, which also performs confirmatory testing.here we present the results of nbs for pku in sweden during 1965-2014 describing an increase in diagnosed patients and a shift in the spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) mutations towards an increasing heterogeneity. milder mutations common in southern europe and the middle east together with lowering of the recall level for phenylalanine (phe) have led to a shift towards milder phenotypes among the patients identified by the screening program. the inclusion of a phe and tyrosine (tyr) ratio as an additional marker has improved the positive predictive value to the present 0.92. also discussed is what impact earlier sampling has had on the prediction of disease severity, concluding that the shift of age at sampling from 72 to 48 h does not increase the risk of missing patients in need of treatment.	-1
evaluation of the contribution of the three breast cancer susceptibility genes chek2, stk11, and palb2 in non-brca1/2 french canadian families with high risk of breast cancer.  inactivating mutations of the chek2 and stk11 genes are responsible for li-fraumeni and peutz-jeghers syndrome, respectively, both autosomal dominant syndromes associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. the palb2/fancn gene encodes a nuclear partner of brca2 and acts as a linker between brca1 and brca2. monoallelic palb2 truncating mutations were shown to confer higher risk of breast cancer. to evaluate the proportion of french canadian non-brca1/brca2 families with high risk of breast cancer potentially harboring alterations in these three breast cancer susceptibility genes, the whole coding and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed in a series of 96 high-risk breast cancer individuals. despite no palb2 deleterious truncating mutations being identified, the c.1100delc breast-cancer-associated chek2 mutation and a stk11 mutation reported to be the causative mutation in a peutz-jeghers family were identified. this extensive analysis also led to the identification of several variants in these genes. ascertainment of allele frequency of these variants in a cohort of 96 healthy unrelated women suggests a difference in allele frequency for two stk11 intronic variants. in addition, large genomic rearrangements in both stk11 and palb2 were also examined. our analysis led to the conclusion that chek2, stk11, and palb2 mutations or large genomic rearrangements of either stk11 or palb2 are rare, and do not contribute to a substantial fraction of breast cancer susceptibility in high-risk french canadian breast cancer families.	1
clinical and molecular characterization of infantile-onset pompe disease in mainland chinese patients: identification of two common mutations.  we sought to understand the clinical course and molecular defects of infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd) among mainland chinese patients. twenty-five chinese patients with iopd were enrolled and clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. the entire coding region of the gaa gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by direct sequencing. the median age at symptom onset was 3.4 months (range: 1.0-7.1 months) and 4.9 months (range: 2.7-8.3 months) at diagnosis. only one patient received enzyme replacement therapy (ert) and this child survived beyond the age of 2 years. of the 24 patients not receiving ert, all, but one patient, died at a median age of 8.3 months (range: 4.0-12.2 months). thirteen novel and two common gaa mutations were identified in this study. the allelic frequency of c.2662g > t (p.glu888x) was 23.1% in northern chinese patients and 4.2% in southern chinese patients, whereas the allelic frequency of c.1935c > a (p.asp645glu) was 20.8% in southern and 3.8% in northern chinese patients. we identified the most common mutations in southern and northern chinese patients with iopd.	-1
plasma mutant ?-galactosidase a protein and globotriaosylsphingosine level in fabry disease.  fabry disease is an x-linked genetic disorder characterized by deficient activity of ?-galactosidase a (gla) and accumulation of glycolipids, and various gla gene mutations lead to a wide range of clinical phenotypes from the classic form to the later-onset one. to investigate the biochemical heterogeneity and elucidate the basis of the disease using available clinical samples, we measured gla activity, gla protein and accumulated globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-gb3), a biomarker of this disease, in plasma samples from fabry patients. the analysis revealed that both the enzyme activity and the protein level were apparently decreased, and the enzyme activity was well correlated with the protein level in many fabry patients. in these cases, a defect of biosynthesis or excessive degradation of mutant glas should be involved in the pathogenesis, and the residual protein level would determine the accumulation of lyso-gb3 and the severity of the disease. however, there are some exceptional cases, i.e., ones harboring p.c142y, p.r112h and p.m296i, who exhibit a considerable amount of gla protein. especially, a subset of fabry patients with p.r112h or p.m296i has been attracted interest because the patients exhibit almost normal plasma lyso-gb3 concentration. structural analysis revealed that c142y causes a structural change at the entrance of the active site. it will lead to a complete enzyme activity deficiency, resulting in a high level of plasma lyso-gb3 and the classic fabry disease. on the other hand, it is thought that r112h causes a relatively large structural change on the molecular surface, and m296i a small one in a restricted region from the core to the surface, both the structural changes being far from the active site. these changes will cause not only partial degradation but also degeneration of the mutant gla proteins, and the degenerated enzymes exhibiting small and residual activity remain and probably facilitate degradation of lyso-gb3 in plasma, leading to the later-onset phenotype. the results of this comprehensive analysis will be useful for elucidation of the basis of fabry disease.	1
update on mutations in glucokinase (gck), which cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young, permanent neonatal diabetes, and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.  glucokinase is a key regulatory enzyme in the pancreatic beta-cell. it plays a crucial role in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been termed the glucose sensor in pancreatic beta-cells. given its central role in the regulation of insulin release it is understandable that mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase (gck) can cause both hyper- and hypoglycemia. heterozygous inactivating mutations in gck cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) subtype glucokinase (gck), characterized by mild fasting hyperglycemia, which is present at birth but often only detected later in life during screening for other purposes. homozygous inactivating gck mutations result in a more severe phenotype presenting at birth as permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (pndm). a growing number of heterozygous activating gck mutations that cause hypoglycemia have also been reported. a total of 620 mutations in the gck gene have been described in a total of 1,441 families. there are no common mutations, and the mutations are distributed throughout the gene. the majority of activating mutations cluster in a discrete region of the protein termed the allosteric activator site. the identification of a gck mutation in patients with both hyper- and hypoglycemia has implications for the clinical course and clinical management of their disorder.	1
a pathogenic role for germline pten variants which accumulate into the nucleus.  the pten gene encodes a master regulator protein that exerts essential functions both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. pten is mutated in the germline of both patients with heterogeneous tumor syndromic diseases, categorized as pten hamartoma tumor syndrome (phts), and a group affected with autism spectrum disorders (asd). previous studies have unveiled the functional heterogeneity of pten variants found in both patient cohorts, making functional studies necessary to provide mechanistic insights related to their pathogenicity. here, we have functionally characterized a pten missense variant [c.49c>g; p.(gln17glu); q17e] associated to both phts and asd patients. the pten q17e variant displayed partially reduced pip3-catalytic activity and normal stability in cells, as shown using s. cerevisiae and mammalian cell experimental models. remarkably, pten q17e accumulated in the nucleus, in a process involving the pten n-terminal nuclear localization sequence. the analysis of additional germline-associated pten n-terminal variants illustrated the existence of a pten n-terminal region whose targeting in disease causes pten nuclear accumulation, in parallel with defects in pip3-catalytic activity in cells. our findings highlight the frequent occurrence of pten gene mutations targeting pten n-terminus whose pathogenicity may be related, at least in part, with the retention of pten in the nucleus. this could be important for the implementation of precision therapies for patients with alterations in the pten pathway.	1
novel mechanism of a cdh1 splicing mutation in a korean patient with signet ring cell carcinoma.  we report a novel mechanism of a cdh1 splicing mutation in a patient with signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach. a 27-year-old man complaining of aggravated dyspepsia was diagnosed with signet ring cell carcinoma. both his father and uncle had died of stomach cancer at a young age. dna sequencing analysis of the cdh1 gene revealed a splice site mutation(c.833-2a>g). by rna/cdna sequencing analysis, cdh1 c.833-2a>g generated a new acceptor site within intron 6, causing the insertion of a 79-bp intronic sequence between exon 6 and 7 (r.833-79_833-1ins), and resulting in a frame shift. e-cadherin immunohistochemical staining revealed a loss of cdh1 expression. this study reveals the disease-causing mechanism of this splicing mutation, and emphasizes the need for functional studies using rna samples for the accurate interpretation of detected splicing variant. this is the first reported case of a cdh1 mutation in a korean patient.	1
unravelling the pathogenic role and genotype-phenotype correlation of the ush2a p.(cys759phe) variant among spanish families.  mutations in ush2a cause both isolated retinitis pigmentosa (rp) and usher syndrome (that implies rp and hearing impairment). one of the most frequent variants identified in this gene and among these patients is the p.(cys759phe) change. however, the pathogenic role of this allele has been questioned since it was found in homozygosity in two healthy siblings of a spanish family. to assess the causative role of ush2a p.(cys759phe) in autosomal recessive rp (arrp) and usher syndrome type ii (ush2) and to establish possible genotype-phenotype correlations associated with p.(cys759phe), we performed a comprehensive genetic and clinical study in patients suffering from any of the two above-mentioned diseases and carrying at least one p.(cys759phe) allele. diagnosis was set according to previously reported protocols. genetic analyses were performed by using classical molecular and next-generation sequencing approaches. probands of 57 unrelated families were molecularly studied and 63 patients belonging to these families were phenotypically evaluated. molecular analysis characterized 100% of the cases, identifying: 11 homozygous patients for ush2a p.(cys759phe), 42 compound heterozygous patients (12 of them with another missense ush2a pathogenic variant and 30 with a truncating ush2a variant), and 4 patients carrying the p.(cys759phe) allele and a pathogenic variant in another rp gene (prom1, cngb1 or rp1). no additional causative variants were identified in symptomatic homozygous patients. statistical analysis of clinical differences between zygosity states yielded differences (p?0.05) in age at diagnosis of rp and hypoacusis, and progression of visual field loss. homozygosity of p.(cys759phe) and compound heterozygosity with another ush2a missense variant is associated with arrp or arrp plus late onset hypoacusis (or = 20.62, ci = 95%, p = 0.041). the present study supports the role of ush2a p.(cys759phe) in arrp and ush2 pathogenesis, and demonstrates the clinical differences between different zygosity states. phenotype-genotype correlations may guide the genetic characterization based upon specific clinical signs and may advise on the clinical management and prognosis based upon a specific genotype.	-1
screening for later-onset pompe's disease in patients with paucisymptomatic hyperckemia.  pompe's disease is an inherited metabolic myopathy caused by acid ?-glucosidase deficiency. early diagnosis optimizes the treatment effectiveness. one-hundred-thirty-seven consecutive patients with unexplained hyperckemia underwent the assessment of acid ?-glucosidase activity on dried blood spot. second tier confirmatory testing in positive patients included the assessment of ?-glucosidase activity on lymphocytes or muscle tissue and molecular analysis. three patients were diagnosed with later-onset pompe's disease, revealing 2.2% prevalence in asymptomatic hyperckemia. moreover, three patients positive to the screening revealed abnormal biochemical second tier testing, but were heterozygous for the common c.-32-13t>g mutation at molecular level. the selective screening for later-onset pompe's disease in asymptomatic hyperckemia allowed the identification of affected patients in a pre-clinical stage. additionally, the identification of carriers with biochemical alterations related to pompe's disease extends the spectrum of its manifestations to heterozygous subjects.	-1
[six novel mutations in pah gene detected by sequencing].  to explore new mutation in phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. the pah genes from 40 phenylketonuria (pku) patients and 30 normal controls were screened by pcr-single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) and further sequencing. eleven mutations and 3 polymorphisms in pah gene were found. no abnormalities in the pah gene from 30 controls were detected. m276k, m276r, 280inst, ivs10nt+32t-->a, ivs4nt+47c-->t were demonstrated as novel mutations in comparison with the pah mutation database. one mission mutation (h290r) was first documented in chinese pku gene.	-1

mlh1 constitutional and somatic methylation in patients with mlh1 negative tumors fulfilling the revised bethesda criteria.  lynch syndrome (ls) is a tumor predisposing condition caused by constitutional defects in genes coding for components of the mismatch repair (mmr) apparatus. while hypermethylation of the promoter of the mmr gene mlh1 occurs in about 15% of colorectal cancer samples, it has also been observed as a constitutional alteration, in the absence of dna sequence mutations, in a small number of ls patients. in order to obtain further insights on the phenotypic characteristics of mlh1 epimutation carriers, we investigated the somatic and constitutional mlh1 methylation status of 14 unrelated subjects with a suspicion of ls who were negative for mmr gene constitutional mutations and whose tumors did not express the mlh1 protein. a novel case of constitutional mlh1 epimutation was identified. this patient was affected with multiple primary tumors, including breast cancer, diagnosed starting from the age of 55 y. investigation of her offspring by allele specific expression revealed that the epimutation was not stable across generations. we also found mlh1 hypermethylation in cancer samples from 4 additional patients who did not have evidence of constitutional defects. these patients had some characteristics of ls, namely early age at onset and/or positive family history, raising the possibility of genetic influences in the establishment of somatic mlh1 methylation.	-1
a molecular analysis of the gaa gene and clinical spectrum in 38 patients with pompe disease in japan.  pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) deficiency, which results in the accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes in multiple tissues, including cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle cells. thus far, 558 sequence variants of the gaa gene have been published in the pompe disease mutation database, and some mutations appear with considerable frequency in particular ethnic groups, such as caucasians, taiwanese, chinese, and koreans. however, the gaa mutation pattern in japanese patients remains poorly understood. we analyzed the relationship between the genetic and clinical features of 38 mostly japanese patients with pompe disease from 35 unrelated families. we identified 28 different gaa gene mutations, including 7 novel mutations, by a gaa gene analysis. c.546g > t (22.9%) and c.1857c > g (14.3%) were the most common mutations and accounted for 37.1% of the total mutant alleles. in the six patients with infantile-onset pompe disease (iopd), c.1857c > g was also the most common mutation. in addition, there were 13 homozygotes (5 with the c.546g > t) among the 35 families, which is the highest frequency reported thus far. regarding the initial symptoms, cardiomegaly was the most common (3/6 = 50%) in iopd patients, while muscle weakness was observed the most frequently in patients with late-onset pompe disease (lopd) (15/30 = 50%). notably, all iopd patients who showed respiratory distress at the time of onset require respiratory assistance at present (4/4 = 100%). regarding the presenting symptoms, cardiomegaly (6/6 = 100%) and hepatomegaly (4/6 = 66.7%) were more commonly seen in iopd, and muscle weakness (24/29 = 82.7%) was observed more frequently in lopd. respiratory assistance is required at present in 33.3% of iopd patients and 50% of lopd patients, and 20% of iopd patients and 29.6% of lopd patients are wheelchair users. these individual clinical courses may be influenced by the timing of the diagnosis and treatment; for example, in 2007, an ert orphan drug for treatment of pompe disease, alglucosidase alfa, was made available in japan, and there were 5 (5/6 = 83.3%) wheelchair users diagnosed from 2008 to 2009 (cases 32-38) and 4 (4/27 = 14.8%) from 2010 to 2015 (cases 1-31). these findings underscore the importance of the early diagnosis and treatment.	-1
prophylactic total gastrectomy for individuals with germline cdh1 mutation.  germline mutation of the cdh1 gene, which encodes for the e-cadherin adhesion protein, is rare but confers an estimated lifetime risk of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer of 87%. fewer than 100 prophylactic total gastrectomies have been reported for this condition. patients with germline cdh1 mutation who underwent multidisciplinary counseling followed by prophylactic total gastrectomy were reviewed. ten patients (6 male, 4 female) with a median age of 42 years (range, 26-51) underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy between 2006 and 2009. of the 6 families represented, there were 4 missense, 1 frameshift, and 1 splice site mutation. median time from genetic testing to surgery was 3 months (range, 1-7). all patients had an upper endoscopy before surgery, identifying only 1 patient with a focus of diffuse gastric cancer. after prophylactic total gastrectomy, extensive pathologic analysis demonstrated that 9 patients had up to 77 foci of noninvasive cancer, and 2 of these patients had 4-12 foci of t1 invasive cancer. median operative time was 213 minutes; there were no anastomotic leaks, and the length of stay was 7-8 days. one patient had a complication within 30 days (pulmonary embolism), and 3 patients had late complications (2 small bowel obstructions and 1 anastomotic stricture). median weight loss at 6 months was 19%. the majority of patients with germline cdh1 mutation have foci of noninvasive or invasive gastric cancer by middle age. serial upper endoscopies provide inadequate screening. prophylactic total gastrectomy is the procedure of choice for definitive treatment.	-1
identification of arare coch mutation by whole-exome sequencing : implications for personalized therapeutic rehabilitation in an austrian family with non-syndromic autosomal dominant late-onset hearing loss.  non-syndromic autosomal dominant hearing impairment is characteristically postlingual in onset. genetic diagnostics are essential for genetic counselling, disease prognosis and understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease. to date, 36 causative genes have been identified, many in only individual families. gene selection for genetic screening by traditional methods and genetic diagnosis in autosomal dominant patients has therefore been fraught with difficulty. whole-exome sequencing provides a powerful tool to analyze all protein-coding genomic regions in parallel, thus allowing the comprehensive screening of all known genes and associated alterations. in this study, a previously undiagnosed late-onset progressive autosomal dominant hearing loss in an austrian family was investigated by means of whole-exome sequencing. results were confirmed by sanger sequencing. a previously described c.151c>t missense (p.pro51ser) mutation in the lccl (limulus factor c, cochlin, late gestation lung protein lgl1) domain of the cochlin gene (coch) was identified as causative and segregated with disease in five members of the family. molecular diagnostics led to the decision to perform cochlear implantation in an index patient who subsequently showed excellent postoperative auditory performance. the c.151c>t mutation was not found in 18 screened austrian families with autosomal dominant hearing loss but was represented alongside other known pathogenic mutant coch alleles in the genome aggregation database (gnomad) in european populations. a combined allele frequency of 0.000128 implies an orphan disease frequency for coch-induced hearing loss of 1:3900 in europe. exome sequencing successfully resolved the genetic diagnosis in a family suffering from autosomal dominant hearing impairment and allowed prediction of purported auditory outcome after cochlear implantation in an index patient. personalized treatment approaches based on the molecular mechanisms of disease may become increasingly important in the future.	-1
clinical and functional characterization of the cdh1 germline variant c.1679c>g in three unrelated families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  germline changes in the cdh1 tumor suppressor gene predispose to diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. in carriers of deleterious germline cdh1 variants, prophylactic gastrectomy is recommended. in case of germline missense variants, it is mandatory to assess the functional impact on e-cadherin, the protein encoded by cdh1, and to predict their clinical significance. herein, we have identified a recurrent germline missense variant, c.1679c>g, segregating with gastric cancer in three unrelated spanish families. through genetic, transcriptional, in silico and in vitro studies, we demonstrate the deleterious effect of the c.1679c>g variant and its association with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, providing relevant data to relatives and allowing an accurate genetic counseling.	-1
a homozygous missense mutation in the ciliary gene ttc21b causes familial fsgs.  several genes, mainly involved in podocyte cytoskeleton regulation, have been implicated in familial forms of primary fsgs. we identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.p209l) in the ttc21b gene in seven families with fsgs. mutations in this ciliary gene were previously reported to cause nephronophthisis, a chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy. notably, tubular basement membrane thickening reminiscent of that observed in nephronophthisis was present in patients with fsgs and the p.p209l mutation. we demonstrated that the ttc21b gene product ift139, an intraflagellar transport-a component, mainly localizes at the base of the primary cilium in developing podocytes from human fetal tissue and in undifferentiated cultured podocytes. in contrast, in nonciliated adult podocytes and differentiated cultured cells, ift139 relocalized along the extended microtubule network. we further showed that knockdown of ift139 in podocytes leads to primary cilia defects, abnormal cell migration, and cytoskeleton alterations, which can be partially rescued by p.p209l overexpression, indicating its hypomorphic effect. our results demonstrate the involvement of a ciliary gene in a glomerular disorder and point to a critical function of ift139 in podocytes. altogether, these data suggest that this homozygous ttc21b p.p209l mutation leads to a novel hereditary kidney disorder with both glomerular and tubulointerstitial damages.	1
infantile-onset glycogen storage disease type ii (pompe disease): report of a case with genetic diagnosis and pathological findings.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsd-ii), also known as pompe disease, is a rare autosomial recessive disease due to deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa). the infantile-onset form is the most severe, and most patients present with hypotonia and cardiomyopathy in early infancy. we report on a typical case of pompe disease in a patient who died at 8 months of age due to aspiration pneumonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. genetic studies showed deficient gaa activity and mutation of the gaa gene with gly615arg (exon 13, g1845a). on autopsy, glycogen had markedly accumulated in the liver, myocardium and skeletal muscle. the neurons of the anterior horn of the spinal cord and medulla were also involved, but the cortex was spared. these neurological-histologic findings may explain the clinical features of poor motor function, decreased deep tendon reflexes and lack of mental retardation.	-1
clinical features and outcome of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with triple sarcomere protein gene mutations.  the aim of this study was to describe the clinical profile associated with triple sarcomere gene mutations in a large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) cohort. in patients with hcm, double or compound sarcomere gene mutation heterozygosity might be associated with earlier disease onset and more severe outcome. the occurrence of triple mutations has not been reported. a total of 488 unrelated index hcm patients underwent screening for myofilament gene mutations by direct deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing of 8 genes, including myosin binding protein c (mybpc3), beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7), regulatory and essential light chains (myl2, myl3), troponin-t (tnnt2), troponin-i (tnni3), alpha-tropomyosin (tpm1), and actin (actc). of the 488 index patients, 4 (0.8%) harbored triple mutations, as follows: myh7-r869h, mybpc3-e258k, and tnni3-a86fs in a 32-year-old woman; myh7-r723c, myh7-e1455x, and mybpc3-e165d in a 46-year old man; myh7-r869h, mybpc3-k1065fs, and mybpc3-p371r in a 45-year old woman; and myh7-r1079q, mybpc3-q969x, and mybpc3-r668h in a 50-year old woman. one had a history of resuscitated cardiac arrest, and 3 had significant risk factors for sudden cardiac death, prompting the insertion of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in all, with appropriate shocks in 2 patients. moreover, 3 of 4 patients had a severe phenotype with progression to end-stage hcm by the fourth decade, requiring cardiac transplantation (n=1) or biventricular pacing (n=2). the fourth patient, however, had clinically mild disease. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by triple sarcomere gene mutations was rare but conferred a remarkably increased risk of end-stage progression and ventricular arrhythmias, supporting an association between multiple sarcomere defects and adverse outcome. comprehensive genetic testing might provide important insights to risk stratification and potentially indicate the need for differential surveillance strategies based on genotype.	-1
molecular scanning analysis of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha (tcf1) gene in typical familial type 2 diabetes in african americans.  type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is strongly inherited, but the major genes for this disease have been elusive. in contrast, early-onset, autosomal-dominant diabetes results from at least 5 loci, of which hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (hnf1alpha or tcf1) is the most common cause. mutations in hnf1alpha also cause later-onset diabetes in some caucasian populations, but the role of these mutations has not been tested in african american populations. we used a variety of screening methods, including both single-strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis and dideoxy fingerprint analysis, to search for mutations in 51 african american subjects with onset of diabetes before age 50 years. potential mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. we identified 21 different variants, of which 11 were unique to african americans. four mutations either altered the amino acid sequence (gly52ala and gly574ser) or were close to a splice site (intron 1 and intron 10). a 5-nucleotide insertion in intron 1 was present in both diabetic members of a small family, but gly52ala, gly574ser, and the intron 10 mutation did not segregate with diabetes. gly574ser was present in 2 large families and 5% of controls, all of which appeared to share the same common hnf1alpha haplotype. surprisingly, radioactive sscp analysis under 2 room-temperature conditions performed as well as methods using fluorescent labeling that were expected to be more sensitive. we conclude that in african american individuals under age 50, variation in the hnf1a gene is common but unlikely to be a significant cause of t2dm.	-1
the molecular bases of phenylketonuria (pku) in new south wales, australia: mutation profile and correlation with tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsiveness.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism predominantly caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. mutation screening was carried out in a large cohort of pku patients from new south wales, australia. pathogenic mutations were identified in 99% of the alleles screened, with the two most common mutations (p.r408w and ivs12+1g>a) accounting for 30.7% of alleles. most individuals were compound heterozygotes for previously reported mutations, but four novel mutations (c.163+1g>t, c.164-2a>g, c.461a>t [p.y154f], and c.510-1g>a) and a novel polymorphism (c.60+62c>t) were also identified. a number of patients have been previously tested for their response to dietary supplementation of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the cofactor of pah. correlation between genotype and the responses revealed that although genotype is a major determinant of bh4 responsiveness, patients with the same genotype may also show disparate responses to this treatment. a clinical and biochemical evaluation should be undertaken to determine the effectiveness of pku treatment by supplementation of bh4.	-1
functional characterisation of alpha-galactosidase a mutations as a basis for a new classification system in fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is an x-linked hereditary defect of glycosphingolipid storage caused by mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase ?-galactosidase a (gla, ?-gal a). to date, over 400 mutations causing amino acid substitutions have been described. most of these mutations are related to the classical fabry phenotype. generally in lysosomal storage disorders a reliable genotype/phenotype correlation is difficult to achieve, especially in fd with its x-linked mode of inheritance. in order to predict the metabolic consequence of a given mutation, we combined in vitro enzyme activity with in vivo biomarker data. furthermore, we used the pharmacological chaperone (pc) 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj) as a tool to analyse the influence of individual mutations on subcellular organelle-trafficking and stability. we analysed a significant number of mutations and correlated the obtained properties to the clinical manifestation related to the mutation in order to improve our knowledge of the identity of functional relevant amino acids. additionally, we illustrate the consequences of different mutations on plasma lyso-globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-gb3) accumulation in the patients' plasma, a biomarker proven to reflect the impaired substrate clearance caused by specific mutations. the established system enables us to provide information for the clinical relevance of pc therapy for a given mutant. finally, in order to generate reliable predictions of mutant gla defects we compared the different data sets to reveal the most coherent system to reflect the clinical situation.	1
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy owing to double heterozygosity for a 403arg--> trp mutation in exon 13 of the myh7 gene and a novel mutation, 453arg--> his, in exon 14 of the myh7 gene: a case report.  an unusual clinical history of a 23-year-old male proband with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with a rare genotype is presented. genetic analysis of the proband found evidence for two distinct mutations of the myh7 gene (the gene coding for the beta-myosin heavy chain): 403arg--> trp in exon 13 and a novel mutation, 453arg--> his, in exon 14. a heterozygous site mutation was identified in exon 13 in the proband's father but no mutation site was found in his mother. thus, the novel mutation in exon 14 is a de novo mutation.	-1
high frequency of mutations in the hnf-1alpha gene in non-obese patients with diabetes of youth in japanese and identification of a case of digenic inheritance.  there is an emerging epidemic of type ii (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus of youth in japan and in many other developed countries. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)-1alpha gene (tcf1) in a large group of japanese patients with early-onset non-type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. since approximately 20% of caucasian patients with hnf-1alpha mutations have been shown to be obese or overweight, we also examined the association of genetic variations in tcf1 with body weight in japanese subjects. we examined 203 patients with non-type 1 diabetes who had been diagnosed before they reached 15 years of age. ten exons and flanking introns of tcf1 of these patients were directly sequenced for mutations. we found 14 different mutations in 18 patients (8.9%), including one that was found to be de novo. the patients with the mutations had lower bmi (20.1+/-3.0 kg/m(2)) at diagnosis than the patients without them (24.5+/-6.0 kg/m(2)) (p=0.0024). all of the patients with the mutations, except for one, y120, had normal body weight (bmi<25 kg/m(2)); the frequency of hnf-1alpha mutations in the non-obese patients of this study was 17% (17/101). patient y120, who had atypical symptoms of mild obesity and insulin resistance at diagnosis, was found to have inherited an additional mutation in an obesity-related gene. a considerable number of non-obese japanese patients with non-type 1 diabetes of youth have hnf-1alpha-deficient diabetes. lack of obesity could well be a characteristic feature of this form of diabetes.	-1
atypical immunologic response in a patient with crim-negative pompe disease.  we report the clinical course of a patient with severe infantile onset pompe disease [cross-reactive immunologic material (crim) negative, r854x/r854x] who was diagnosed prenatally and received standard dosing of alglucosidase alfa (myozyme) enzyme replacement therapy (ert) from day 10 of life until she passed away at the age of 3 years 9 months. in the immediate neonatal period there was cardiomegaly on chest x-ray, cardiac hypertrophy by echocardiogram, and development of a wide complex tachycardia. crim negative (cn) status was suspected based on her family history, and the available data at the time indicated that cn patients had limited survival even with ert. however, given the opportunity for very early treatment, the treating provider and family elected to initiate treatment with ert, without immune modulation. by 9 months of age echocardiogram was normal. early motor development was within normal limits but by 2 years of age her developmental progress had slowed. she seroconverted by the 4th month of ert, and anti-rhgaa antibody titers peaked at 25,600 in the 27th month. immunomodulatory therapy was considered but declined by family. she acquired influenza a at 2 years 6 months, which led to a prolonged hospitalization with invasive respiratory support, and placement of tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube. her developmental progress ceased, and she died suddenly at home from a presumed cardiac event at age 3 years 9 months. the poor outcomes observed in cn patients have been attributed to the development of high sustained antibody titers. although this cn patient's anti-rhgaa response was elevated and sustained, it is unlike any of the 3 patterns that have been previously described: high titer cn, high titer crim positive (htcp), and low titer cp (ltcp) patients. this patient's clinical course, with achievement of 24 months of motor gains, 30 months of ventilator-free survival and 45 month survival, is like that of only a fraction of ert treated cn patients, yet it is identical to other reported cn patients in its relentless progression and early fatality. the immunologic response (moderate sustained antibody titers) described here has not been previously reported and may have played a role in the overall pattern of developmental decline. in light of proposed universal newborn screening for pompe disease, there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the interplay between immunologic responses to the only available treatment, ert, and the relentless nature of this disease in cn patients.	-1

targeted high-throughput sequencing identifies pathogenic mutations in kcnq4 in two large chinese families with autosomal dominant hearing loss.  autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss (adnshl) is highly heterogeneous, among them, kcnq4 is one of the most frequent disease-causing genes. more than twenty kcnq4 mutations have been reported, but none of them were detected in chinese mainland families. in this study, we identified a novel kcnq4 mutation in a five generation chinese family with 84 members and a known kcnq4 mutation in a six generation chinese family with 66 members. mutation screening of 30 genes for adnshl was performed in the probands from thirty large chinese families with adnshl by targeted region capture and high-throughput sequencing. the candidate variants and the co-segregation of the phenotype were verified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sanger sequencing in all ascertained family members. then we identified a novel kcnq4 mutation p.w275r in exon 5 and a known kcnq4 mutation p.g285s in exon 6 in two large chinese adnshl families segregating with post-lingual high frequency-involved and progressive sensorineural hearing loss. this is the first report of kcnq4 mutation in chinese mainland families. kcnq4, a member of voltage-gated potassium channel family, is likely to be a common gene in chinese patients with adnshl. the results also support that the combination of targeted enrichment and high-throughput sequencing is a valuable molecular diagnostic tool for autosomal dominant hereditary deafness.	-1
chinese hamster ovary cell-derived recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase in infantile-onset pompe disease.  to conduct an open-label, multinational, multicenter study examining the safety and efficacy of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhgaa) in treatment of infantile-onset pompe disease. we enrolled 8 infant patients who had pompe disease with gaa activity <1% of normal, cardiomyopathy, and hypotonia. in the 52-week initial phase, rhgaa was infused intravenously at 10 mg/kg weekly; an extension phase continued survivors' treatment with 10 to 20 mg/kg of rhgaa weekly or 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks for as long as 153 weeks. safety measurements included adverse events, laboratory tests, and anti-rhgaa antibody titers. efficacy evaluations included survival, ventilator use, echocardiograms, growth, and motor and cognitive function. after 52 weeks of treatment, 6 of 8 patients were alive, and 5 patients were free of invasive ventilator support. clinical improvements included ameliorated cardiomyopathy and improved growth and cognition. five patients acquired new motor milestones; 3 patients walked independently. four patients died after the initial study phase; the median age at death or treatment withdrawal for all patients was 21.7 months, significantly later than expected for patients who were not treated. treatment was safe and well tolerated; no death was drug-related. rhgaa improved ventilator-free survival, cardiomyopathy, growth, and motor function in patients with infantile-onset pompe disease compared with outcomes expected for patients without treatment.	-1
haematological spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in nine unrelated families with runx1 mutations from the french network on inherited platelet disorders.  less than 50 patients with fpd/aml (omim 601309) have been reported as of today and there may an underestimation. the purpose of this study was to describe the natural history, the haematological features and the genotype-phenotype correlations of this entity in order to, first, screen it better and earlier, before leukaemia occurrence and secondly to optimize appropriate monitoring and treatment, in particular when familial stem cell transplantation is considered. we have investigated 41 carriers of runx1 alteration belonging to nine unrelated french families with fpd/aml and two syndromic patients, registered in the french network on rare platelet disorders from 2005 to 2015. five missense, one non-sense, three frameshift mutations and two large deletions involving several genes including runx1 were evidenced. the history of familial leukaemia was suggestive of fpd/aml in seven pedigrees, whereas an autosomal dominant pattern of lifelong thrombocytopenia was the clinical presentation of two. additional syndromic features characterized two large sporadic deletions. bleeding tendency was mild and thrombocytopenia moderate (>50 x10(9)/l), with normal platelet volume. a functional platelet defect consistent with a ?-granule release defect was found in ten patients regardless of the type of runx1 alteration. the incidence of haematological malignancies was higher when the mutated runx1 allele was likely to cause a dominant negative effect (19/34) in comparison with loss of function alleles (3/9). a normal platelet count does not rule out the diagnosis of fpd/aml, since the platelet count was found normal for three mutated subjects, a feature that has a direct impact in the search for a related donor in case of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. platelet dysfunction suggestive of defective ?-granule release could be of values for the diagnosis of fpd/aml particularly when the clinical presentation is an autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia with normal platelet size in the absence of familial malignancies. the genotype-phenotype correlations might be helpful in genetic counselling and appropriate optimal therapeutic management.	-1
burden of recurrent and ancestral mutations in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetically heterogeneous myocardial disease with >1000 causal variants identified. nonunique variants account for disease in many families. we sought to characterize nonunique variants in australian families and determine whether they arise from common ancestral mutations or recurrent mutation events. genetic test results of 467 index patients from apparently unrelated families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were evaluated. causal variants were found in 185 of 467 (40%) families. nonunique variants accounted for 122 of 185 (66%) families. the most common single genetic cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the recurrent mybpc3 (myosin-binding protein-c) variant c.1504c>t, p.arg502trp, which was found in 13 of 185 (7%) families with a causal variant identified. thirteen variants inmybpc3 andmyh7 (myosin heavy chain 7) were each identified >3 times and accounted for 78 of 185 (42%) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy families with a causal variant. haplotype analysis of these 13 variants was performed on 126 individuals from 70 australian families, and 11 variants arose through recurrent mutation events. two variants,mybpc3 c.1928-2a>g andmyh7 c.2681a>g, p.glu894gly, were found on 1 haplotype in 6 families each, supportive of a single mutation event inherited from a common ancestor. the majority of families with a causal variant identified have a nonunique variant. discovery of the genetic origins of human disease forms a fundamental basis for improved understanding of disease pathogenesis and phenotype development.	-1
revisiting li-fraumeni syndrome from tp53 mutation carriers.  the aim of the study was to update the description of li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs), a remarkable cancer predisposition characterized by extensive clinical heterogeneity. from 1,730 french patients suggestive of lfs, we identified 415 mutation carriers in 214 families harboring 133 distinct tp53 alterations and updated their clinical presentation. the 322 affected carriers developed 552 tumors, and 43% had developed multiple malignancies. the mean age of first tumor onset was 24.9 years, 41% having developed a tumor by age 18. in childhood, the lfs tumor spectrum was characterized by osteosarcomas, adrenocortical carcinomas (acc), cns tumors, and soft tissue sarcomas (sts) observed in 30%, 27%, 26%, and 23% of the patients, respectively. in adults, the tumor distribution was characterized by the predominance of breast carcinomas observed in 79% of the females, and sts observed in 27% of the patients. the tp53 mutation detection rate in children presenting with acc or choroid plexus carcinomas, and in females with breast cancer before age 31 years, without additional features indicative of lfs, was 45%, 42% and 6%, respectively. the mean age of tumor onset was statistically different (p < .05) between carriers harboring dominant-negative missense mutations (21.3 years) and those with all types of loss of function mutations (28.5 years) or genomic rearrangements (35.8 years). affected children, except those with acc, harbored mostly dominant-negative missense mutations. the clinical gradient of the germline tp53 mutations, which should be validated by other studies, suggests that it might be appropriate to stratify the clinical management of lfs according to the class of the mutation.	-1
genetic testing for sporadic hearing loss using targeted massively parallel sequencing identifies 10 novel mutations.  the genetic heterogeneity of non-syndromic hearing loss (nshl) has hampered the identification of its pathogenic mutations. several recent studies applied targeted genome enrichment (tge) and massively parallel sequencing (mps) to simultaneously screen a large set of known hearing loss (hl) genes. however, most of these studies were focused on familial cases. to evaluate the effectiveness of tge and mps on screening sporadic nshl patients, we recruited 63 unrelated sporadic nshl probands, who had various levels of hl and were excluded for mutations in gjb2, mt-rnr1, and slc26a4 genes. tge and mps were performed on 131 known hl genes using the human deafness panel oto-da3 (otogenetics corporation., norcross, ga). we identified 14 pathogenic variants in strc, catsper2, ush2a, triobp, myo15a, gpr98, and tmprss3 genes in eight patients (diagnostic rate = 12.7%). among these variants, 10 were novel compound heterozygous mutations. the identification of pathogenic mutations could predict the progression of hl, and guide diagnosis and treatment of the disease.	-1
[analysis of clinical features of 6 patients with infantile type glycogen storage disease type ii].  to summarize clinical features and diagnosis of chinese infantile patients with glycogen storage disease type ii (gsd ii). six infant patients with gsd ii diagnosed from january 2012 to june 2014 in the department of pediatrics, peking university first hospital were enrolled into this study. clinical information of the 6 patients, including clinical manifestation, blood biochemistry, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) activity and gaa gene mutation analysis by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product were reviewed. of the 6 patients, five were female and one was male, five of whom were classic infantile type while the other one was atypical. the age of onset ranged from birth to 3-month-old. all patients had varying degrees of generalized muscle weakness, hypotonia and development retardation or retrogression. other common findings were feeding difficulties in two patients, tongue weakness in two patients, respiratory distress in four patients, macroglossia in one patient, and hepatomegaly in two patients. left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomegaly were obvious in all the six patients. all six patients were found to have a enlarged heart in physical examination, and three patients who underwent a chest x-ray examination had an enlarged heart shadow. four patients who had an echocardiography were found to have myocardial hypertrophy. the electrocardiogram in three patients showed short pr intervals and high voltage. the creatine kinase (ck) levels were three to seven times elevated. the mildest elevated ck was 441 iu/l, and the highest ck level was 1 238 u/l. assay of gaa enzyme activity in whole blood showed significantly reduced activity (1.3 nmol/ (spotd) to 2 nmol/(spotd)) in the patients tested. gene sequencing in 4 patients showed 8 pathogenic mutations, including 6 missense mutations, one nonsense mutation and one frameshift mutation. the missense mutations were c.998c > a (p.thr333lys), c.1280t > c (p.met427thr), c.1760t > c (p.leu587pro), c.1924g > t (p.val642phe), c.2012t > a (p.met671lys) and c.2105g > a (p.arg702his). the nonsense mutation was c2662g > t (p.glu888x), and the frameshift mutation was c2812_2813deltg (p.cys938fs). the 5 classic infantile patients died at the age of 7 to 22 months. the atypical infantile patient was 2 years and five months old according to our latest follow up. infantile gsd ii had similar motor manifestations and cardiac involvements, blood biochemical test, imaging findings, enzyme assays, though there were slight differences. the probability of gsd ii should be taken into consideration if an infant has both muscular disease and cardiac involvement.	-1
twenty-two novel mutations in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene (gaa) underscore the genotype-phenotype correlation in glycogen storage disease type ii.  patients with glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii, pompe disease) suffer from progressive muscle weakness due to acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. the disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. we have investigated 29 cases of gsdii and thereby identified 55 pathogenic mutations of the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (gaa) encoding acid maltase. there were 34 different mutations identified, 22 of which were novel. all of the missense mutations and two other mutations with an unpredictable effect on acid alpha-glucosidase synthesis and function were transiently expressed in cos cells. the effect of a novel splice-site mutation was investigated by real-time pcr analysis. the outcome of our analysis underscores the notion that the clinical phenotype of gsdii is largely dictated by the nature of the mutations in the gaa alleles. this genotype-phenotype correlation makes dna analysis a valuable tool to help predict the clinical course of the disease.	1
palb2, chek2 and atm rare variants and cancer risk: data from cogs.  the rarity of mutations in palb2, chek2 and atm make it difficult to estimate precisely associated cancer risks. population-based family studies have provided evidence that at least some of these mutations are associated with breast cancer risk as high as those associated with rare brca2 mutations. we aimed to estimate the relative risks associated with specific rare variants in palb2, chek2 and atm via a multicentre case-control study. we genotyped 10 rare mutations using the custom icogs array: palb2 c.1592delt, c.2816t>g and c.3113g>a, chek2 c.349a>g, c.538c>t, c.715g>a, c.1036c>t, c.1312g>t, and c.1343t>g and atm c.7271t>g. we assessed associations with breast cancer risk (42 671 cases and 42 164 controls), as well as prostate (22 301 cases and 22 320 controls) and ovarian (14 542 cases and 23 491 controls) cancer risk, for each variant. for european women, strong evidence of association with breast cancer risk was observed for palb2 c.1592delt or 3.44 (95% ci 1.39 to 8.52, p=7.110-5), palb2 c.3113g>a or 4.21 (95% ci 1.84 to 9.60, p=6.910-8) and atm c.7271t>g or 11.0 (95% ci 1.42 to 85.7, p=0.0012). we also found evidence of association with breast cancer risk for three variants in chek2, c.349a>g or 2.26 (95% ci 1.29 to 3.95), c.1036c>t or 5.06 (95% ci 1.09 to 23.5) and c.538c>t or 1.33 (95% ci 1.05 to 1.67) (p?0.017). evidence for prostate cancer risk was observed for chek2 c.1343t>g or 3.03 (95% ci 1.53 to 6.03, p=0.0006) for african men and chek2 c.1312g>t or 2.21 (95% ci 1.06 to 4.63, p=0.030) for european men. no evidence of association with ovarian cancer was found for any of these variants. this report adds to accumulating evidence that at least some variants in these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer that is clinically important.	1
"protein stability and in vivo concentration of missense mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase.  a previous computational analysis of missense mutations linked to monogenic disease found a high proportion of missense mutations affect protein stability, rather than other aspects of protein structure and function. the purpose of this study is to relate the presence of such stability damaging missense mutations to the levels of a particular protein present under ""in vivo"" like conditions, and to test the reliability of the computational methods. experimental data on a set of missense mutations of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) associated with the monogenic disease phenylketonuria (pku) have been compared with the expected in vivo impact on protein function, obtained using snps3d, an in silico analysis package. a high proportion of the pah mutations are predicted to be destabilizing. the overall agreement between predicted stability impact and experimental evidence for lower protein levels is in accordance with the estimated error rates of the methods. for these mutations, destabilization of protein three-dimensional structure is the major molecular mechanism leading to pku, and results in a substantial reduction of in vivo pah protein concentration. although of limited scale, the results support the view that destabilization is the most common mechanism by which missense mutations cause monogenic disease. in turn, this conclusion suggests the general therapeutic strategy of developing drugs targeted at restoring wild type stability."	1
functional effects of ptpn11 (shp2) mutations causing leopard syndrome on epidermal growth factor-induced phosphoinositide 3-kinase/akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3beta signaling.  leopard syndrome (ls), a disorder with multiple developmental abnormalities, is mainly due to mutations that impair the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase shp2 (ptpn11). how these alterations cause the disease remains unknown. we report here that fibroblasts isolated from ls patients displayed stronger epidermal growth factor (egf)-induced phosphorylation of both akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (gsk-3beta) than fibroblasts from control patients. similar results were obtained in hek293 cells expressing ls mutants of shp2. we found that the gab1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from ls than control subjects and that both akt and gsk-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing gab1 expression or by overexpressing a gab1 mutant unable to bind to pi3k. consistently, purified recombinant ls mutants failed to dephosphorylate gab1 pi3k-binding sites. these mutants induced pi3k-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (anf) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes. in conclusion, shp2 mutations causing ls facilitate egf-induced pi3k/akt/gsk-3beta stimulation through impaired gab1 dephosphorylation, resulting in deregulation of a novel signaling pathway that could be involved in ls pathology.	1
a novel germline mutation of the pten gene in a patient with macrocephaly, ventricular dilatation, and features of vater association.  mutations of the pten gene are associated with hamartoma-neoplasia syndromes. while germline mutations at this chromosome 10q22-23 locus have been observed in patients with cowden syndrome (cs) and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brr), both of which phenotypes are associated with hamartomata and neoplasia, somatic mutation of pten has been established in a wide variety of sporadically occurring neoplasia. cs and brr share some clinical features, specifically hamartomata and lipomatosis. investigation of other clinically distinct syndromes associated with lipomatosis and overgrowth has established germline and germline mosaic pten mutations in several patients with proteus syndrome. to this expanding array of clinically distinct phenotypes associated with pten mutations, we now report a novel heterozygous germline mutation, h61d, in a patient with features of vater association with macrocephaly and ventriculomegaly.	-1
germline tp53 mutations result into a constitutive defect of p53 dna binding and transcriptional response to dna damage.  li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) results from heterozygous germline mutations of tp53, encoding a key transcriptional factor activated in response to dna damage. we have recently shown, from a large lfs series, that dominant-negative missense mutations are the most clinically severe and, thanks to a new p53 functional assay in lymphocytes, that they alter the p53 transcriptional response to dna damage more drastically than null mutations. in this study, we first confirmed this observation by performing the p53 functional assay in lymphocytes from 56 tp53 mutation carriers harbouring 35 distinct alterations. then, to compare the impact of the different types of germline tp53 mutations on dna binding, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (chip-seq) in lymphocytes exposed to doxorubicin. chip-seq performed in wild-type tp53 control lymphocytes accurately mapped 1287 p53-binding sites. new p53-binding sites were validated using a functional assay in yeast. chip-seq analysis of lfs lymphocytes carrying tp53 null mutations (p.p152rfs*18 or complete deletion) or the low penetrant 'brazilian' p.r337h mutation revealed a moderate decrease of p53-binding sites (949, 580 and 620, respectively) and of chip-seq peak depths. in contrast, analysis of lfs lymphocytes with tp53 dominant-negative missense mutations p.r273h or p.r248w revealed only 310 and 143 p53-binding sites, respectively, and the depths of the corresponding peaks were drastically reduced. altogether, our results show that tp53 mutation carriers exhibit a constitutive defect of the transcriptional response to dna damage and that the clinical severity of tp53 dominant-negative missense mutations is explained by a massive and global alteration of p53 dna binding.	1
systematic population screening, using biomarkers and genetic testing, identifies 2.5% of the u.k. pediatric diabetes population with monogenic diabetes.  monogenic diabetes is rare but is an important diagnosis in pediatric diabetes clinics. these patients are often not identified as this relies on the recognition of key clinical features by an alert clinician. biomarkers (islet autoantibodies and c-peptide) can assist in the exclusion of patients with type 1 diabetes and allow systematic testing that does not rely on clinical recognition. our study aimed to establish the prevalence of monogenic diabetes in u.k. pediatric clinics using a systematic approach of biomarker screening and targeted genetic testing. we studied 808 patients (79.5% of the eligible population) <20 years of age with diabetes who were attending six pediatric clinics in south west england and tayside, scotland. endogenous insulin production was measured using the urinary c-peptide creatinine ratio (ucpcr). c-peptide-positive patients (ucpcr ?0.2 nmol/mmol) underwent islet autoantibody (gad and ia2) testing, with patients who were autoantibody negative undergoing genetic testing for all 29 identified causes of monogenic diabetes. a total of 2.5% of patients (20 of 808 patients) (95% ci 1.6-3.9%) had monogenic diabetes (8 gck, 5 hnf1a, 4 hnf4a, 1 hnf1b, 1 abcc8, 1 insr). the majority (17 of 20 patients) were managed without insulin treatment. a similar proportion of the population had type 2 diabetes (3.3%, 27 of 808 patients). this large systematic study confirms a prevalence of 2.5% of patients with monogenic diabetes who were <20 years of age in six u.k. clinics. this figure suggests that ?50% of the estimated 875 u.k. pediatric patients with monogenic diabetes have still not received a genetic diagnosis. this biomarker screening pathway is a practical approach that can be used to identify pediatric patients who are most appropriate for genetic testing.	-1
mutations of pten in patients with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba phenotype.  we report three new mutations in pten, the gene responsible for cowden disease in five patients with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome from three unrelated families. this finding confirms that cowden disease, a dominant cancer predisposing syndrome, and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome, which includes macrocephaly, multiple lipomas, intestinal hamartomatous polyps, vascular malformations, and pigmented macules of the penis, are allelic disorders at the pten locus on chromosome 10q.	-1
fabry disease: twenty-three mutations including sense and antisense cpg alterations and identification of a deletional hot-spot in the alpha-galactosidase a gene.  fabry disease, an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene at xq22.1. to determine the nature and frequency of the molecular lesions causing the classical and milder variant fabry phenotypes, and for precise carrier detection in fabry families, the alpha-galactosidase a coding and flanking intronic sequences from 23 unrelated fabry hemizygotes were analyzed. in patients with the classic phenotype, 16 new missense and nonsense mutations and four small exonic gene rearrangements were identified: c52s, c56f, e59k, l89r, r100k, r112h, l131p, a143p, g144v, c172y, d244n, n272k, a288d, w81x, q99x, q157x, r301x, 25del1, 333del18, 358del6, and 1020del1. the r112h mutation at a cpg dinucleotide resulted in residual activity and a mild variant phenotype while the r112c lesion caused the classic disease manifestations, defining a genotype/phenotype correlation for sense and antisense mutations at the same cpg dinucleotide. in addition, two complex rearrangements, each involving two mutational events, occurred in classic hemizygotes. both rearrangements resulted in missense mutations that did not change the reading frame. notably, three of the deletions occurred within 11 codons in exon 2, thereby defining a 'hot-spot' for deletions. these studies revealed that most mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene causing fabry disease were private, that codons 111-122 defined a deletion hot-spot, and that different substitutions of the same codon resulted in markedly different disease phenotypes.	-1
mlh1-silenced and non-silenced subgroups of hypermutated colorectal carcinomas have distinct mutational landscapes.  approximately 15% of colorectal carcinomas (crcs) exhibit a hypermutated genotype accompanied by high levels of microsatellite instability (msi-h) and defects in dna mismatch repair. these tumours, unlike the majority of colorectal carcinomas, are often diploid, exhibit frequent epigenetic silencing of the mlh1 dna mismatch repair gene, and have a better clinical prognosis. as an adjunct study to the cancer genome atlas consortium that recently analysed 224 colorectal cancers by whole exome sequencing, we compared the 35 crcs (15.6%) with a hypermutated genotype to those with a non-hypermutated genotype. we found that 22 (63%) of the hypermutated crcs exhibited transcriptional silencing of the mlh1 gene, a high frequency of braf v600e gene mutations, and infrequent apc and kras mutations, a mutational pattern significantly different from their non-hypermutated counterparts. however, the remaining 13 (37%) hypermutated crcs lacked mlh1 silencing, contained tumours with the highest mutation rates ('ultramutated' crcs), and exhibited higher incidences of apc and kras mutations, but infrequent braf mutations. these patterns were confirmed in an independent validation set of 250 exome-sequenced crcs. analysis of mrna and microrna expression signatures revealed that hypermutated crcs with mlh1 silencing had greatly reduced levels of wnt signalling and increased braf signalling relative to non-hypermutated crcs. our findings suggest that hypermutated crcs include one subgroup with fundamentally different pathways to malignancy than the majority of crcs. examination of mlh1 expression status and frequencies of apc, kras, and braf mutation in crc may provide a useful diagnostic tool that could supplement the standard microsatellite instability assays and influence therapeutic decisions.	-1
genetic analysis and follow-up of 25 neonatal diabetes mellitus patients in china.  to study the clinical features, genetic etiology, and the correlation between phenotype and genotype of neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) in chinese patients. we reviewed the medical records of 25 ndm patients along with their follow-up details. molecular genetic analysis was performed. we compared the hba1c levels between pndm group and infantile-onset t1dm patients. of 25 ndm patients, 18 (72.0%) were pndm and 7 (28.0%) were tndm. among 18 pndm cases, 6 (33.3%) had known katp channel mutations (katp-pndm). there were six non-katp mutations, five novel mutations, including ins, eif2ak3 (n = 2), glis3, and slc19a2, one known eif2ak3 mutation. there are two abcc8 mutations in tndm cases and one paternal upd6q24. five of the six katp-pndm patients were tried for glyburide transition, and 3 were successfully switched to glyburide. mean hba1c of pndm was not significantly different from infantile onset t1dm (7.2% versus 7.4%, p = 0.41). pndm accounted for 72% of ndm patients. about one-third of pndm and tndm patients had katp mutations. the genetic etiology could be determined in 50% of pndm and 43% of tndm cases. pndm patients achieved good glycemic control with insulin or glyburide therapy. the etiology of ndm suggests polygenic inheritance.	-1
associations of cdh1 germline variant location and cancer phenotype in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc).  hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc) is a cancer syndrome associated with variants in e-cadherin (cdh1), diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. there is considerable heterogeneity in its clinical manifestations. this study aimed to determine associations between cdh1 germline variant status and clinical phenotypes of hdgc. one hundred and fifty-two hdgc families, including six previously unreported families, were identified. cdh1 gene-specific guidelines released by the clinical genome resource (clingen) cdh1 variant curation expert panel were applied for pathogenicity classification of truncating, missense and splice site cdh1 germline variants. we evaluated ors between location of truncating variants of cdh1 and incidence of colorectal cancer, breast cancer and cancer at young age (gastric cancer at <40 or breast cancer <50 years of age). frequency of truncating germline cdh1 variants varied across functional domains of the e-cadherin receptor gene and was highest in linker (0.05785 counts/base pair; p=0.0111) and pre regions (0.10000; p=0.0059). families with truncating cdh1 germline variants located in the pre-pro region were six times more likely to have family members affected by colorectal cancer (or 6.20, 95% ci 1.79 to 21.48; p=0.004) compared with germline variants in other regions. variants in the intracellular e-cadherin region were protective for cancer at young age (or 0.2, 95% ci 0.06 to 0.64; p=0.0071) and in the linker regions for breast cancer (or 0.35, 95% ci 0.12 to 0.99; p=0.0493). different cdh1 genotypes were associated with different intracellular signalling activation levels including different p-erk, p-mtor and ?-catenin levels in early submucosal t1a lesions of hdgc families with different cdh1 variants. type and location of cdh1 germline variants may help to identify families at increased risk for concomitant cancers that might benefit from individualised surveillance and intervention strategies.	-1
discordant phenylketonuria phenotypes in one family: the relationship between genotype and clinical outcome is a function of multiple effects.  four members spanning three generations of one family have phenylketonuria of varying degrees of severity. two first cousins were screened in the neonatal period and have had dietary phenylalanine restriction since diagnosis, the older patient having been classified as having more severe pku and the younger one as having mild pku. their mutual grandfather and his older brother also have a significant hyperphenylalaninaemia and are of normal intelligence despite never having had restricted phenylalanine intake. mutation analysis of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene has established that there are four different mutations, two in exon 2 (f39l and l48s) and two in exon 3 (r111x and s67p), which give rise to pku in this family. in order to establish their relative severity, we screened the pku populations of western scotland and the south west of england for these mutations. the exon 3 mutations are rare; however, f39l is relatively common in scotland and l48s in england. a comparison of diagnostic blood phenylalanine concentrations in subjects carrying l48s/null or f39l/null mutations with those carrying two null mutations suggest that these exon 2 mutations are less deleterious. thus, in this family, the different biochemical phenotypes can be explained, in part, by different genotypes at the pah locus but our results show that the relationship between genotype and clinical outcome is more complex and is a function of multiple effects.	-1
prevalence of germline pten, bmpr1a, smad4, stk11, and eng mutations in patients with moderate-load colorectal polyps.  gastrointestinal polyposis is a common clinical problem, yet there is no consensus on how to best manage patients with moderate-load polyposis. identifying genetic features of this disorder could improve management and especially surveillance of these patients. we sought to determine the prevalence of hamartomatous polyposis-associated mutations in the susceptibility genes pten, bmpr1a, smad4, eng, and stk11 in individuals with ?5 gastrointestinal polyps, including at least 1 hamartomatous or hyperplastic/serrated polyp. we performed a prospective, referral-based study of 603 patients (median age: 51 years; range, 2-89 years) enrolled from june 2006 through january 2012. genomic dna was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes and analyzed for specific mutations and large rearrangements in pten, bmpr1a, smad4, and stk11, as well as mutations in eng. recursive partitioning analysis was used to determine cutoffs for continuous variables. the prevalence of mutations was compared using fisher's exact test. logistic regression analyses were used to determine univariate and multivariate risk factors. of 603 patients, 119 (20%) had a personal history of colorectal cancer and most (n = 461 [76%]) had <30 polyps. seventy-seven patients (13%) were found to have polyposis-associated mutations, including 11 in eng (1.8%), 13 in pten (2.2%), 13 in stk11 (2.2%), 20 in bmpr1a (3.3%), and 21 in smad4 (3.5%). univariate clinical predictors for risk of having these mutations included age at presentation younger than 40 years (19% vs 10%; p = .008), a polyp burden of ?30 (19% vs 11%; p = .014), and male sex (16% vs 10%; p = .03). patients who had ?1 ganglioneuroma (29% vs 2%; p < .001) or presented with polyps of ?3 histologic types (20% vs 2%; p = .003) were more likely to have germline mutations in pten. age younger than 40 years, male sex, and specific polyp histologies are significantly associated with risk of germline mutations in hamartomatous-polyposis associated genes. these associations could guide clinical decision making and further investigations.	-1
?-myosin heavy chain variant val606met causes very mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in mice, but exacerbates hcm phenotypes in mice carrying other hcm mutations.  approximately 40% of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is caused by heterozygous missense mutations in ?-cardiac myosin heavy chain (?-mhc). associating disease phenotype with mutation is confounded by extensive background genetic and lifestyle/environmental differences between subjects even from the same family. to characterize disease caused by ?-cardiac myosin heavy chain val606met substitution (vm) that has been identified in several hcm families with wide variation of clinical outcomes, in mice. unlike 2 mouse lines bearing the malignant myosin mutations arg453cys (rc/+) or arg719trp (rw/+), vm/+ mice with an identical inbred genetic background lacked hallmarks of hcm such as left ventricular hypertrophy, disarray of myofibers, and interstitial fibrosis. even homozygous vm/vm mice were indistinguishable from wild-type animals, whereas rc/rc- and rw/rw-mutant mice died within 9 days after birth. however, hypertrophic effects of the vm mutation were observed both in mice treated with cyclosporine, a known stimulator of the hcm response, and compound vm/rc heterozygous mice, which developed a severe hcm phenotype. in contrast to all heterozygous mutants, both systolic and diastolic function of vm/rc hearts was severely impaired already before the onset of cardiac remodeling. the vm mutation per se causes mild hcm-related phenotypes; however, in combination with other hcm activators it exacerbates the hcm phenotype. double-mutant mice are suitable for assessing the severity of benign mutations.	1
male-to-male transmission of costello syndrome: g12s hras germline mutation inherited from a father with somatic mosaicism.  costello syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly syndrome associated with mental retardation and predisposition to benign and malignant tumors, caused by heterozygous missense mutations in the hras oncogene. previously, all molecularly analyzed mutations appeared de novo, and most arose in the paternal germline. a single patient with somatic mosaicism for a costello syndrome causing hras mutation has been reported. here we describe the first documented transmission of an hras mutation from a parent with somatic mosaicism to a child with typical costello syndrome. prior to the identification of the underlying gene mutation in costello syndrome, this family had been identified clinically. the proband was subsequently found to carry a g12s hras germline mutation. testing of the parents for parental origin identified his father as mosaic for the same hras mutation. the mother was found not to carry an hras mutation. the causative familial mutation is identified as a c.34g > a, which is the most common mutation in the hras gene in patients with costello syndrome. the father carries the mutation in 7-8% of his alleles. this is the second case of mosaicism observed in costello syndrome and the first direct molecular evidence of father-to-son transmission of the disease-causing mutation. our observation underlines the importance of parental evaluation, and may have implications for genetic counseling and clinical practice.	-1
dominant-negative features of mutant tp53 in germline carriers have limited impact on cancer outcomes.  germline tp53 mutations result in cancer proneness syndromes known as li-fraumeni, li-fraumeni-like, and nonsyndromic predisposition with or without family history. to explore genotype/phenotype associations, we previously adopted a functional classification of all germline tp53 mutant alleles based on transactivation. severe deficiency (sd) alleles were associated with more severe cancer proneness syndromes, and a larger number of tumors, compared with partial deficiency (pd) alleles. because mutant p53 can exert dominant-negative (dn) effects, we addressed the relationship between dn and clinical manifestations. we reasoned that dn effects might be stronger in familial cancer cases associated with germline tp53 mutations, where mutant alleles coexist with the wild-type allele since conception. we examined 104 p53 mutant alleles with single amino acid substitutions described in the iarc germline database for (i) transactivation capability and (ii) capacity to reduce the activity of the wild-type allele (i.e., dn effect) using a quantitative yeast-based assay. the functional classifications of p53 alleles were then related to clinical variables. we confirmed that a classification based on transactivation alone can identify familial cancer cases with more severe clinical features. classification based on dn effects allowed us to highlight similar associations but did not reveal distinct clinical subclasses of sd alleles, except for a correlation with tumor tissue prevalence. we conclude that in carriers of germline tp53 mutations transactivation-based classification of tp53 alleles appears more important for genotype/phenotype correlations than dn effects and that haplo-insufficiency of the tp53 gene is an important factor in cancer proneness in humans.	1
expressivity of hearing loss in cases with usher syndrome type iia.  the purpose of this study was to compare the genotype/phenotype relationship between siblings with identical ush2a pathologic mutations and the consequent audiologic phenotypes, in particular degree of hearing loss (hl). decade audiograms were also compared among two groups of affected subjects with different mutations of ush2a. dna samples from patients with usher syndrome type ii were analysed. the audiological features of patients and affected siblings with ush2a mutations were also examined to identify genotype-phenotype correlations. genetic and audiometric examinations were performed in 18 subjects from nine families with usher syndrome type iia. three different ush2a mutations were identified in the affected subjects. both similarities and differences of the auditory phenotype were seen in families with several affected siblings. a variable degree of hearing loss, ranging from mild to profound, was observed among affected subjects. no significant differences in hearing thresholds were found the group of affected subjects with different pathological mutations. our results indicate that mutations in the ush2a gene and the resulting phenotype are probably modulated by other variables, such as modifying genes, epigenetics or environmental factors which may be of importance for better understanding the etiology of usher syndrome.	-1
functional analysis of the p.(leu15pro) and p.(gly20arg) sequence changes in the signal sequence of ldl receptor.  the low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) is a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism. it contains 860 amino acids including a 21 amino acid long signal sequence, which directs the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum. mutations in the ldlr gene lead to cholesterol accumulation in the plasma and results in familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). knowledge of the impact of a mutation on the ldlr protein structure and function is very important for the diagnosis and management of fh. unfortunately, for a large proportion of mutations this information is still missing. in this study, we focused on the ldlr signal sequence and carried out functional and in silico analyses of two sequence changes, p.(gly20arg) and p.(leu15pro), localized in this part of the ldlr. our results revealed that the p.(gly20arg) change, previously described as disease causing, has no detrimental effect on protein expression or ldl particle binding. in silico analysis supports this observation, showing that both the wt and p.(gly20arg) signal sequences adopt an expected ?-helix structure. in contrast, the mutation p.(leu15pro) is not associated with functional protein expression and exhibits a structure with disrupted a ?-helical arrangement in the signal sequence, which most likely affects protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.	1
familial hypercholesterolemia in greek children and their families: genotype-to-phenotype correlations and a reconsideration of ldlr mutation spectrum.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is a common lipid metabolism disease, resulting in premature atherosclerosis, even from childhood. we aimed to define the genetic basis of fh in children and their families, to refine the spectrum of low-density lipoprotein receptor gene (ldlr) mutations and identify genotype-to-phenotype correlations in patients of greek origin. ldlr was analyzed in 561 patients from 262 families, by whole-gene sequencing. children with identified ldlr mutations showed higher lipid levels compared to non-carriers. molecular analysis identified a mutation in 53.4% of index cases. twenty six ldlr mutations were identified, including 19 point mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, 3 splice site mutations and 2 small insertions. amongst patients with common mutations, carriers of c.1646g > a and c.1285g > a showed higher lipid levels, whereas carriers of c.858c > a and c.81c > g showed a milder phenotype. the spectrum of ldlr mutations in greece is refined and expanded, with more patients analyzed by whole-gene sequencing. although a quick screening method is feasible for the greek population, whole-gene sequencing is essential to identify rare variants. children with border line lipid levels and a family history of hypercholesterolemia should be considered for molecular diagnosis, since carriers of certain mutations show milder phenotypes and may be missed during clinical diagnosis.	-1
mutation screen and rna analysis disclose the changed splicing of the e-cadherin transcription in gastric cancer.  gastric cancer (gc) is considered to be one of the leading cancers in east asians, and mutations in the cdh1 gene and the reduced expression of e-cadherin are the most frequent genetic alterations in gastric cancer. in this paper, we reported two novel germline cdh1 nonsynonymous mutations, c.1296 c>g (n432 k) and c.1297 g>a (d433 n) detected in sporadic chinese gc patients. rna splicing analysis was used to evaluate mutations' effects on e-cadherin transcription and exon definition. we revealed that the c.1296 c>g (n432 k) variant can generate the e-cadherin exon9-skipping and may be a disease-causing mutation, while the c.1297 g>a (d433 n) mutation not. moreover, we demonstrated the e-cadherin 1054del83 transcript is a frequent event in chinese gc patients.	1
long-term treatment and diagnosis of tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia with a mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase gene.  a novel therapeutic strategy for phenylketonuria (pku) has been initiated in japan. a total of 12 patients who met the criteria for tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4))-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) with a mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) (ec 1.14.16.1) gene were recruited at 12 medical centers in japan between june 1995 and july 2001. therapeutic efficacy of bh(4) was evaluated in single-dose, four-dose, and 1-wk bh(4) loading tests followed by long-term bh(4) treatment, and also examined in relation to the pah gene mutations. the endpoints were determined as the percentage decline in serum phenylalanine from initial values after single-dose (>20%), four-dose (>30%), and 1-wk bh(4) (>50%) loading tests. patients with mild pku exhibiting decreases in blood phenylalanine concentrations of >20% in the single-dose test also demonstrated decreases of >30% in the four-dose test. the 1-wk test elicited bh(4) responsiveness even in patients with poor responses in the shorter tests. patients with mild hpa, many of whom carry the r241c allele, responded to bh(4) administration. no clear correlation was noted between the degree of decrease in serum phenylalanine concentrations in the single- or four-dose tests and specific pah mutations. the 1-wk test (20 mg/kg of bh(4) per day) is the most sensitive test for the diagnosis of bh(4)-responsive pah deficiency. responsiveness apparently depends on mutations in the pah gene causing mild pku, such as r241c. bh(4) proved to be an effective therapy that may be able to replace or liberalize the phenylalanine-restricted diets for a considerable number of patients with mild pku.	1
germline mutations in the pten gene in israeli patients with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome and women with familial breast cancer.  germline mutations in brca1 or brca2 account for the majority of inherited breast cancer cases. yet, in up to 40% of familial breast cancer cases, no mutations can be detected in either gene. germline mutations in pten underlie two inherited syndromes: cowden disease (cd) and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs). the known association of cd with breast cancer risk made it plausible that germline mutations within pten may play a role in inherited predisposition to breast cancer. the nine coding exons of the pten gene were screened for harboring germline mutations using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) complemented by sequencing, in two subsets of israeli patients: 12 patients clinically diagnosed with brrs, and 89 women with an apparent inherited predisposition to breast cancer, some with salient features of cd. two of three familial brrs patients exhibited novel germline mutations in pten: a missense mutation changing methionine to arginine at codon 134, and insertion of two nucleotides (ca) at cdna position 1215 resulting in a frameshift at codon 61 and a premature stop at codon 99. among 89 high-risk women, two missense mutations were detected in exon 4: a to c change at cdna position 1279 resulting in a change of aspargine to threonine at codon 82 (n82t), and a g to an a alteration in 1269 which alters threonine to alanine at codon 78 (t78a), a non-conservative missense mutation. this study suggests that pten does not play a major role in predisposing to hereditary breast cancer in israeli women, and that detection of pten mutations in brrs patients is more likely in familial cases.	-1
combination of two different homozygote mutations in pompe disease.  pompe disease (omim no 232300) is an autosomal recessive inherited metabolic disorder, caused by glycogen accumulation in the lysosome due to deficiency of the lysosomal acid 03b1-glucosidase enzyme. here we report the case of an 8-month-old girl of consanguineous turkish parents, who was diagnosed with the infantile form of pompe disease. two different uncommon homozygote mutations (c.32-13 t > g homozygote and c.1856g > a homozygote) were detected. the patient had a more progressive clinical course than expected. we emphasize the rare combination of genetic mutations in this turkish family with pompe disease.	-1
the activity of wild type and mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase with respect to the c-oxidation of phenylalanine and the s-oxidation of s-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine.  the involvement of the enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah), in the s-oxidation of s-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine (scmc) is now firmly established in man and rat. however, the underlying role of the molecular genetics of pah in dictating and influencing the s-oxidation polymorphism of scmc metabolism is as yet unknown. in this work we report that the s-oxidation of scmc was dramatically reduced in the tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)) responsive mutant pah proteins (i65t, r68s, r261q, v388m and y414c) with these enzymes possessing between 1.2% and 2.0% of the wild type pah activity when scmc was used as substrate. these same mutant proteins express between 23% and 76% of the wild type pah activity when phenylalanine was used as the substrate. the pah mutant proteins (r158q, i174t and r408w) that result in the classical phenylketonuria (pku) phenotype expressing 0.2-1.8% of the wild type pah activity when using phenylalanine as substrate were found to have <0.1% of the wild type pah activity when scmc was used as the substrate. mutations that result in pah proteins retaining some residual pah activity with phenylalanine as substrate have <2.0% residual activity when scmc was used as a substrate. this investigation has led to the hypothesis that the s-oxidation polymorphism in man is a consequence of an individual carrying one mutant pah allele which has resulted in the loss of the ability of the residual pah protein to undertake the s-oxidation of scmc in vivo.	1
molecular characterization of polish patients with familial hypercholesterolemia: novel and recurrent ldlr mutations.  autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (adh) is caused by mutations in the genes coding for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), apolipoprotein b-100 (apob), or proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9). in this study, a molecular analysis of ldlr and apob was performed in a group of 378 unrelated adh patients, to explore the mutation spectrum that causes hypercholesterolemia in poland. all patients were clinically diagnosed with adh according to a uniform protocol and internationally accepted who criteria. mutational analysis included all exons, exon-intron boundaries and the promoter sequence of the ldlr, and a fragment of exon 26 of apob. additionally, the mlpa technique was applied to detect rearrangements within ldlr. in total, 100 sequence variations were identified in 234 (62%) patients. within ldlr, 40 novel and 59 previously described sequence variations were detected. of the 99 ldlr sequence variations, 71 may be pathogenic mutations. the most frequent ldlr alteration was a point mutation p.g592e detected in 38 (10%) patients, followed by duplication of exons 4-8 found in 16 individuals (4.2%). twenty-five cases (6.6%) demonstrated the p.r3527q mutation of apob. our findings imply that major rearrangements of the ldlr gene as well as 2 point mutations (p.g592e in ldlr and p.r3527q in apob) are frequent causes of adh in poland. however, the heterogeneity of ldlr mutations detected in the studied group confirms the requirement for complex molecular studies of polish adh patients.	-1
sanger confirmation is required to achieve optimal sensitivity and specificity in next-generation sequencing panel testing.  next-generation sequencing (ngs) has rapidly replaced sanger sequencing as the method of choice for diagnostic gene-panel testing. for hereditary-cancer testing, the technical sensitivity and specificity of the assay are paramount as clinicians use results to make important clinical management and treatment decisions. there is significant debate within the diagnostics community regarding the necessity of confirming ngs variant calls by sanger sequencing, considering that numerous laboratories report having 100% specificity from the ngs data alone. here we report our results from 20,000 hereditary-cancer ngs panels spanning 47 genes, in which all 7845 nonpolymorphic variants were sanger- sequenced. of these, 98.7% were concordant between ngs and sanger sequencing and 1.3% were identified as ngs false-positives, located mainly in complex genomic regions (a/t-rich regions, g/c-rich regions, homopolymer stretches, and pseudogene regions). simulating a false-positive rate of zero by adjusting the variant-calling quality-score thresholds decreased the sensitivity of the assay from 100% to 97.8%, resulting in the missed detection of 176 sanger-confirmed variants, the majority in complex genomic regions (n = 114) and mosaic mutations (n = 7). the data illustrate the importance of setting quality thresholds for panel testing only after thousands of samples have been processed and the necessity of sanger confirmation of ngs variants to maintain the highest possible sensitivity.	-1
the pharmacological chaperone 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin increases alpha-galactosidase a levels in fabry patient cell lines.  fabry disease is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a), with consequent accumulation of its major glycosphingolipid substrate, globotriaosylceramide (gl-3). over 500 fabry mutations have been reported; approximately 60% are missense. the iminosugar 1-deoxygalactonojirimycin (dgj, migalastat hydrochloride, at1001) is a pharmacological chaperone that selectively binds alpha-gal a, increasing physical stability, lysosomal trafficking, and cellular activity. to identify dgj-responsive mutant forms of alpha-gal a, the effect of dgj incubation on alpha-gal a levels was assessed in cultured lymphoblasts from males with fabry disease representing 75 different missense mutations, one insertion, and one splice-site mutation. baseline alpha-gal a levels ranged from 0 to 52% of normal. increases in alpha-gal a levels (1.5- to 28-fold) after continuous dgj incubation for 5 days were seen for 49 different missense mutant forms with varying ec(50) values (820 nmol/l to >1 mmol/l). amino acid substitutions in responsive forms were located throughout both structural domains of the enzyme. half of the missense mutant forms associated with classic (early-onset) fabry disease and a majority (90%) associated with later-onset fabry disease were responsive. in cultured fibroblasts from males with fabry disease, the responses to dgj were comparable to those of lymphoblasts with the same mutation. importantly, elevated gl-3 levels in responsive fabry fibroblasts were reduced after dgj incubation, indicating that increased mutant alpha-gal a levels can reduce accumulated substrate. these data indicate that dgj merits further evaluation as a treatment for patients with fabry disease with various missense mutations.	1
mutation spectrum of phenylketonuria in iranian population.  identification of molecular basis of phenylketonuria (pku) in iran has been accomplished through the analysis of 248 unrelated chromosomes from 124 iranian classic pku subjects. phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations were analyzed through a combined approach in which p.s67p, p.r252w, p.r261q, p.r261x, p.l333f, ivs10-11g>a, ivs11+1g>c, p.l364del, p.r408q and p.r408w mutations were first screened by pcr of pah gene exons 3, 7, 10, 11 and 12, followed by digestion with the appropriate digestion enzymes. subsequently sscp analysis for exons 2, 6, 7 and 11 of the pah gene and finally, sequencing of 13 pah gene exons have been used to study uncharacterized pku chromosomes. 26 different mutations were found. the predominant mutation in this population sample was ivs10-11g>a, with a frequency of 24.6%. nine mutations (ivs10-11g>a, p.r261q, p.p281l, ivs11+1g>c, p.k363>nfs, p.r243x, ivs2+5g>c, p.r261x and p.r252w) represent almost 84% of all pku chromosomes studied. ivs10-11g>a mutation is the major pku-causing mutation throughout the mediterranean region. the finding of the high prevalence of this mutation in iranian population is consistent with the historical and geographical links between iranian and mediterranean populations.	-1
prevalence and diversity of constitutional mutations in the p53 gene among 21 li-fraumeni families.  the entire coding sequence of the p53 gene was analysed for the presence of mutations in 12 families conforming to a restricted definition of li-fraumeni syndrome (classic lfs) and nine families with features of lfs conforming to a broader definition. mutations were detected in seven families. six were point mutations with one each affecting codons 175, 180, and 220 and three affecting codon 248. the seventh was a deletion/insertion mutation in exon 4. germline mutations in p53 were a feature of families which included children with rhabdomyosarcoma and/or adrenal cortical carcinoma. germline p53 mutations were detected in six of the nine families with such tumors. an analysis of these 7 mutations, together with 34 published examples, showed that more than one-half were transitions at cpg dinucleotides, suggesting that the majority of germline p53 mutations may arise as a result of spontaneous events. the most common cancers occurring in the 41 families with germline p53 mutations, in common with classic lfs, were bone and soft tissue sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, and adrenocortical carcinoma, although less than one-half of the probands with germline p53 mutations came from classic lfs families. more than one-half of the cancers overall and nearly one-third of the breast cancers were diagnosed before 30 years of age. these observations have important implications for asymptomatic carriers of germline p53 mutations, and there is a need for international collaboration in the development of protocols for the management of such families.	-1

"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: distribution of disease genes, spectrum of mutations, and implications for a molecular diagnosis strategy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an autosomal-dominant disorder in which 10 genes and numerous mutations have been reported. the aim of the present study was to perform a systematic screening of these genes in a large population, to evaluate the distribution of the disease genes, and to determine the best molecular strategy in clinical practice. the entire coding sequences of 9 genes (myh7, mybpc3, tnni3, tnnt2, myl2, myl3, tpm1, actc, andtnnc1) were analyzed in 197 unrelated index cases with familial or sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. disease-causing mutations were identified in 124 index patients ( approximately 63%), and 97 different mutations, including 60 novel ones, were identified. the cardiac myosin-binding protein c (mybpc3) and beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7) genes accounted for 82% of families with identified mutations (42% and 40%, respectively). distribution of the genes varied according to the prognosis (p=0.036). moreover, a mutation was found in 15 of 25 index cases with ""sporadic"" hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (60%). finally, 6 families had patients with more than one mutation, and phenotype analyses suggested a gene dose effect in these compound-heterozygous, double-heterozygous, or homozygous patients. these results might have implications for genetic diagnosis strategy and, subsequently, for genetic counseling. first, on the basis of this experience, the screening of already known mutations is not helpful. the analysis should start by testing mybpc3 and myh7 and then focus on tnni3, tnnt2, and myl2. second, in particularly severe phenotypes, several mutations should be searched. finally, sporadic cases can be successfully screened."	-1
congenital heart disease in maternal phenylketonuria: report from the maternal pku collaborative study.  the frequency and types of congenital heart disease in offspring from pregnancies in women with hyperphenylalaninemia were examined in the international prospective maternal phenylketonuria collaborative study. relationships of congenital heart disease in offspring to the basal blood phenylalanine level in the mother, metabolic control through diet during pregnancy, and phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in mother and offspring were determined. the 416 offspring from 412 maternal phenylketonuria pregnancies that produced live births and 100 offspring from the 99 control pregnancies were included in this examination. thirty-four of the 235 offspring (14%; 95% ci, 10.2 to 19.6%) from pregnancies in phenylketonuric women with a basal phenylalanine level > or = 900 microm (15 mg/dl) [normal blood phenylalanine < 120 microm (2 mg/dl)] and not in metabolic control [phenylalanine level < or = 600 microm (10 mg/dl)] by the eighth gestational week had congenital heart disease compared with one control offspring (1%) with congenital heart disease. one offspring among the 50 (2%) from mothers with non-phenylketonuria mild hyperphenylalaninemia also had congenital heart disease. coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were overrepresented compared with expected percentages among those with congenital heart disease in the general population. a basal maternal phenylalanine level > 1800 microm (30 mg/dl) significantly increased the risk for bearing a child with congenital heart disease (p = 0.003). phenylalanine hydroxylase mutations in the mothers and offspring did not have an independent relationship to congenital heart disease but were related through the basal maternal phenylalanine levels. the data in this study indicate that a basal maternal phenylalanine level of 900 microm may be a threshold for congenital heart disease, that women with the most severe degree of phenylketonuria are at highest risk for bearing such a child, and that prevention of the congenital heart disease requires initiation of the low phenylalanine diet before conception or early in pregnancy with metabolic control no later than the eighth gestational week.	-1
irhom2-dependent regulation of adam17 in cutaneous disease and epidermal barrier function.  irhom2 is a highly conserved, catalytically inactive member of the rhomboid family, which has recently been shown to regulate the maturation of the multi-substrate ectodomain sheddase enzyme adam17 (tace) in macrophages. dominant irhom2 mutations are the cause of the inherited cutaneous and oesophageal cancer-susceptibility syndrome tylosis with oesophageal cancer (toc), suggesting a role for this protein in epithelial cells. here, using tissues derived from toc patients, we demonstrate that toc-associated mutations in irhom2 cause an increase in the maturation and activity of adam17 in epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in significantly upregulated shedding of adam17 substrates, including egf-family growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. this activity is accompanied by increased egfr activity, increased desmosome processing and the presence of immature epidermal desmosomes, upregulated epidermal transglutaminase activity and heightened resistance to staphylococcal infection in toc keratinocytes. many of these features are consistent with the presence of a constitutive wound-healing-like phenotype in toc epidermis, which may shed light on a novel pathway in skin repair, regeneration and inflammation.	1
mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha gene in mody and early-onset niddm: evidence for a mutational hotspot in exon 4.  we have recently shown that mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (hnf)-1alpha are the cause of one form of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody3). here, we report the exon-intron organization and partial sequence of the human hnf-1alpha gene. in addition, we have screened the ten exons and flanking introns of this gene for mutations in a group of 25 unrelated white subjects from germany who presented with niddm before 35 years of age and had a first-degree relative with niddm. mutations were identified in nine of these individuals, suggesting that mutations in the hnf-1alpha gene are a common cause of diabetes in german subjects with early-onset niddm and a family history of diabetes. thus, screening for mutations in this gene may be indicated in subjects with early-onset niddm. interestingly, three of the nine mutations occurred at the same site in exon 4 with insertion of a c in a polyc tract, centered around codon 290 (designated pro291fsinsc), thereby resulting in a frameshift during translation and premature termination. analyses of linked dna polymorphisms in the hnf-1alpha gene indicated that the pro291fsinsc mutation was present on a different haplotype in each subject, implying that the polyc tract represents a mutational hot spot. we have also identified the mutation in the hnf-1alpha gene in the jutland pedigree, one of the original mody pedigrees reported in the literature, as being a t-->g substitution in codon 241, resulting in the replacement of a conserved cys by gly (c241g). the information on the sequence of the hnf-1alpha gene and its promoter region will facilitate the search for mutations in other subjects and studies of the role of the gene in determining normal beta-cell functions.	-1
two extremes of the clinical spectrum of glycogen storage disease type ii in one family: a matter of genotype.  mutation analysis was performed in a nonconsanguineous dutch caucasian family with a grandfather presenting the first symptoms of glycogen storage disease type ii (acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency) in the sixth decade of life and a grandchild with onset of symptoms shortly after birth. the grandfather was identified as compound heterozygote having the ivs1(-13t-->g)/delta t525 combination of mutant acid alpha-glucosidase alleles, the affected third generation offspring as homozygote delta t525/delta t525. the disease phenotypes in this family are in accordance with the genotypes since the ivs1(-13t-->g) mutation reduces acid alpha-glucosidase synthesis by 60 to 80%, whereas the delta t525 mutation completely prohibits the formation of catalytically active enzyme. four additional families were identified with patients homozygote for delta t525 and five others with an equally deleterious delta t525/delta exon 18 genotype. the nine latter patients had typically the infantile form of glycogen storage disease type ii. the genotype-phenotype correlation is irrefutable.	-1
global molecular analysis and apoe mutations in a cohort of autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia patients in france.  autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (adh) is a human disorder characterized phenotypically by isolated high-cholesterol levels. mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), apob, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) genes are well known to be associated with the disease. to characterize the genetic background associated with adh in france, the three adh-associated genes were sequenced in a cohort of 120 children and 109 adult patients. fifty-one percent of the cohort had a possible deleterious variant in ldlr, 3.1% in apob, and 1.7% in pcsk9. we identified 18 new variants in ldlr and 2 in pcsk9. three ldlr variants, including two newly identified, were studied by minigene reporter assay confirming the predicted effects on splicing. additionally, as recently an in-frame deletion in the apoe gene was found to be linked to adh, the sequencing of this latter gene was performed in patients without a deleterious variant in the three former genes. an apoe variant was identified in three patients with isolated severe hypercholesterolemia giving a frequency of 1.3% in the cohort. therefore, even though ldlr mutations are the major cause of adh with a large mutation spectrum, apoe variants were found to be significantly associated with the disease. furthermore, using structural analysis and modeling, the identified apoe sequence changes were predicted to impact protein function.	-1
melanocortin 4 receptor mutations in obese czech children: studies of prevalence, phenotype development, weight reduction response, and functional analysis.  mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor gene (mc4r) represent the most common known cause of monogenic human obesity. the aims of this study were the following: 1) to estimate the prevalence of mc4r mutations in obese czech children; 2) to evaluate phenotypic features of the mutation carriers; 3) to compare weight, height, and body mass index of mc4r mutation carriers with noncarriers in longitudinal studies; 4) to determine the effect of a weight management program among mc4r mutation carriers; and 5) to perform a functional analysis of a novel variant. we analyzed the coding region of mc4r in a cohort of 289 czech children and adolescents with early-onset obesity by direct sequencing. information on weight, height, body mass index, baseline biochemical data, and a weight loss follow-up study was obtained. in vitro functional analysis of one novel variant was performed. we identified six different mutations in seven probands: one novel missense mutation cys84arg and five previously reported variants, arg7cys, ser19fsdela, phe51leu, ser127leu, and gly181asp. the gly181asp variant was detected in one homozygous carrier from unrelated parents. none of the mutation carriers fulfilled the mc4r syndrome criteria. a comparison of anthropometrics in mutation carriers and noncarriers during 13 yr of follow-up did not reveal any significant differences. mc4r mutation carriers exhibited a similar ability to lose weight as obese noncarriers. the novel variant cys84arg showed a significant reduction in camp signal properties of the mc4r. among obese czech children, we found a prevalence of 2.4% of mc4r homozygous and heterozygous mutations and showed a similar response to diet management of mc4r mutation carriers and noncarriers.	-1
long-term intravenous treatment of pompe disease with recombinant human alpha-glucosidase from milk.  recent reports warn that the worldwide cell culture capacity is insufficient to fulfill the increasing demand for human protein drugs. production in milk of transgenic animals is an attractive alternative. kilogram quantities of product per year can be obtained at relatively low costs, even in small animals such as rabbits. we tested the long-term safety and efficacy of recombinant human -glucosidase (rhaglu) from rabbit milk for the treatment of the lysosomal storage disorder pompe disease. the disease occurs with an estimated frequency of 1 in 40,000 and is designated as orphan disease. the classic infantile form leads to death at a median age of 6 to 8 months and is diagnosed by absence of alpha-glucosidase activity and presence of fully deleterious mutations in the alpha-glucosidase gene. cardiac hypertrophy is characteristically present. loss of muscle strength prevents infants from achieving developmental milestones such as sitting, standing, and walking. milder forms of the disease are associated with less severe mutations and partial deficiency of alpha-glucosidase. in the beginning of 1999, 4 critically ill patients with infantile pompe disease (2.5-8 months of age) were enrolled in a single-center open-label study and treated intravenously with rhaglu in a dose of 15 to 40 mg/kg/week. genotypes of patients were consistent with the most severe form of pompe disease. additional molecular analysis failed to detect processed forms of alpha-glucosidase (95, 76, and 70 kda) in 3 of the 4 patients and revealed only a trace amount of the 95-kda biosynthetic intermediate form in the fourth (patient 1). with the more sensitive detection method, 35s-methionine incorporation, we could detect low-level synthesis of -glucosidase in 3 of the 4 patients (patients 1, 2, and 4) with some posttranslation modification from 110 kda to 95 kda in 1 of them (patient 1). one patient (patient 3) remained totally deficient with both detection methods (negative for cross-reactive immunologic material [crim negative]). the alpha-glucosidase activity in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts of all 4 patients was below the lower limit of detection (<2% of normal). the rhaglu was tolerated well by the patients during >3 years of treatment. anti-rhaglu immunoglobulin g titers initially increased during the first 20 to 48 weeks of therapy but declined thereafter. there was no consistent difference in antibody formation comparing crim-negative with crim-positive patients. muscle alpha-glucosidase activity increased from <2% to 10% to 20% of normal in all patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment with 15 to 20 mg/kg/week. for optimizing the effect, the dose was increased to 40 mg/kg/week. this resulted, 12 weeks later, in normal alpha-glucosidase activity levels, which were maintained until the last measurement in week 72. importantly, all 4 patients, including the patient without any endogenous alpha-glucosidase (crim negative), revealed mature 76- and 70-kda forms of -glucosidase on western blot. conversion of the 110-kda precursor from milk to mature 76/70-kda alpha-glucosidase provides evidence that the enzyme is targeted to lysosomes, where this proteolytic processing occurs. at baseline, patients had severe glycogen storage in the quadriceps muscle as revealed by strong periodic acid-schiff--positive staining and lacework patterns in hematoxylin and eosin--stained tissue sections. the muscle pathology correlated at each time point with severity of signs. periodic acid-schiff intensity diminished and number of vacuoles increased during the first 12 weeks of treatment. twelve weeks after dose elevation, we observed signs of muscle regeneration in 3 of the 4 patients. obvious improvement of muscular architecture was seen only in the patient who learned to walk. clinical effects were significant. all patients survived beyond the age of 4 years, whereas untreated patients succumb at a median age of 6 to 8 months. the characteristic cardiac hypertrophy present at start of treatment diminished significantly. the left ventricular mass index decreased from 171 to 599 g/m2 (upper limit of normal 86.6 g/m2 for infants from 0 to 1 year) to 70 to 160 g/m2 during 84 weeks of treatment. in addition, we found a significant change of slope for the diastolic thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall against time at t = 0 for each separate patient. remarkably, the younger patients (patients 1 and 3) showed no significant respiratory problems during the first 2 years of life. one of the younger patients recovered from a life-threatening bronchiolitis at the age of 1 year without sequelae, despite borderline oxygen saturations at inclusion. at the age of 2, however, she became ventilator dependent after surgical removal of an infected port-a-cath. she died at the age of 4 years and 3 months suddenly after a short period of intractable fever of >42 degrees c, unstable blood pressure, and coma. the respiratory course of patient 1 remained uneventful. the 2 older patients, who both were hypercapnic (partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 10.6 and 9.8 kpa; normal range: 4.5-6.8 kpa) at start of treatment, became ventilator dependent before the first infusion (patient 2) and after 10 weeks of therapy (patient 4). patient 4 was gradually weaned from the ventilator after 1 year of high-dose treatment and was eventually completely ventilator-free for 5 days, but this situation could not be maintained. currently, both patients are completely ventilator dependent. the most remarkable progress in motor function was seen in the younger patients (patients 1 and 3). they achieved motor milestones that are unmet in infantile pompe disease. patient 1 learned to crawl (12 months), walk (16 months), squat (18 months), and climb stairs (22 months), and patient 3 learned to sit unsupported. the alberta infant motor scale score for patients 2, 3, and 4 remained far below p5. patient 1 followed the p5 of normal. our study shows that a safe and effective medicine can be produced in the milk of mammals and encourages additional development of enzyme replacement therapy for the several forms of pompe disease. restoration of skeletal muscle function and prevention of pulmonary insufficiency require dosing in the range of 20 to 40 mg/kg/week. the effect depends on residual muscle function at the start of treatment. early start of treatment is required.	-1
the molecular basis of phenylketonuria in koreans.  phenylketonuria (pku) is an inborn error of metabolism that results from a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). we characterized the pah mutations of 79 independent korean patients with pku or hyperphenylalaninemia. pah nucleotide sequence analysis revealed 39 different mutations, including ten novel mutations. the novel mutations consisted of nine missense mutations (p69s, g103s, n207d, t278s, p281a, l293m, g332v, s391i, and a447p) and a novel splice site variant (ivs10-3c>g). r243q, ivs4-1g>a, and e6-96a>g were the most prevalent mutations, as they accounted for 32% of the total mutant alleles in this study. although some common characteristics of allele frequency and distribution were identified among oriental populations, several distinctive characteristics were revealed in korean patients. although the r413p allele is the most prevalent form (30.5%) in japanese, we detected it in only five chromosomes from 158 independent chromosomes (3.2%). the a259t allele, which has not yet been found in oriental populations, was frequently found in this study. we also observed that tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4) responsiveness was associated with specific genotypes (r53h, r241c, and r408q), suggesting there are some correlations between phenotype and genotype.	-1
kcnq4, a novel potassium channel expressed in sensory outer hair cells, is mutated in dominant deafness.  potassium channels regulate electrical signaling and the ionic composition of biological fluids. mutations in the three known genes of the kcnq branch of the k+ channel gene family underlie inherited cardiac arrhythmias (in some cases associated with deafness) and neonatal epilepsy. we have now cloned kcnq4, a novel member of this branch. it maps to the dfna2 locus for a form of nonsyndromic dominant deafness. in the cochlea, it is expressed in sensory outer hair cells. a mutation in this gene in a dfna2 pedigree changes a residue in the kcnq4 pore region. it abolishes the potassium currents of wild-type kcnq4 on which it exerts a strong dominant-negative effect. whereas mutations in kcnq1 cause deafness by affecting endolymph secretion, the mechanism leading to kcnq4-related hearing loss is intrinsic to outer hair cells.	1
pancreatic histopathology of human monogenic diabetes due to causal variants in kcnj11, hnf1a, gata6, and lmna.  monogenic diabetes is thought to account for 2% of all diabetes cases, but most patients receive misdiagnoses of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. to date, little is known about the histopathological features of pancreata from patients with monogenic diabetes. retrospective study of the jdrf network for pancreatic organ donors with diabetes biorepository to identify possible cases of monogenic diabetes and to compare effects of genetic variants on pancreas histology. we selected cases of diabetes for genetic testing on the basis of criteria that included young age at diagnosis, low body mass index, negative autoantibody status, and/or detectable c-peptide level. samples underwent next-generation-targeted sequencing of 140 diabetes/diabetes-related genes. pancreas weight and histopathology were reviewed. forty-one of 140 cases of diabetes met the clinical inclusion criteria, with 38 dna samples available. genetic variants of probable clinical significance were found in four cases: one each in kcnj11, hnf1a, gata6, and lmna. the kcnj11 and hnf1a samples had significantly decreased pancreas weight and insulin mass similar to that of type 1 diabetes but had no insulitis. the gata6 sample had severe pancreatic atrophy but with abundant ? cells and severe amyloidosis similar to type 2 diabetes. the lmna sample had preserved pancreas weight and insulin mass but abnormal islet architecture and exocrine fatty infiltrates. four cases of diabetes had putative causal variants in monogenic diabetes genes. this study provides further insight into the heterogeneous nature of monogenic diabetes cases that exhibited clinical and pathophysiological features that overlap with type 1/type 2 diabetes.	-1

rare variants in app, psen1 and psen2 increase risk for ad in late-onset alzheimer's disease families.  pathogenic mutations in app, psen1, psen2, mapt and grn have previously been linked to familial early onset forms of dementia. mutation screening in these genes has been performed in either very small series or in single families with late onset ad (load). similarly, studies in single families have reported mutations in mapt and grn associated with clinical ad but no systematic screen of a large dataset has been performed to determine how frequently this occurs. we report sequence data for 439 probands from late-onset ad families with a history of four or more affected individuals. sixty sequenced individuals (13.7%) carried a novel or pathogenic mutation. eight pathogenic variants, (one each in app and mapt, two in psen1 and four in grn) three of which are novel, were found in 14 samples. thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in ad cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. the frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09  10??; or = 2.21; 95%ci = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82  10??; or = 2.19; 95%ci = 1.347-3.26). rare coding variants in app, psen1 and psen2, increase risk for or cause late onset ad. the presence of variants in these genes in load and early-onset ad demonstrates that factors other than the mutation can impact the age at onset and penetrance of at least some variants associated with ad. mapt and grn mutations can be found in clinical series of ad most likely due to misdiagnosis. this study clearly demonstrates that rare variants in these genes could explain an important proportion of genetic heritability of ad, which is not detected by gwas.	-1
detection of novel germline mutations in six breast cancer predisposition genes by targeted next-generation sequencing.  in this study, a customized amplicon-based target sequencing panel was designed to enrich the whole exon regions of six genes associated with the risk of breast cancer. targeted next-generation sequencing (ngs) was performed for 146 breast cancer patients (bc), 71 healthy women with a family history of breast cancer (high risk), and 55 healthy women without a family history of cancer (control). sixteen possible disease-causing mutations on four genes were identified in 20 samples. the percentages of possible disease-causing mutation carriers in the bc group (8.9%) and in the high-risk group (8.5%) were higher than that in the control group (1.8%). the brca1 possible disease-causing mutation group had a higher prevalence in family history and triple-negative breast cancer, while the brca2 possible disease-causing mutation group was younger and more likely to develop axillary lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05). among the 146 patients, 47 with a family history of breast cancer were also sequenced with another 14 moderate-risk genes. three additional possible disease-causing mutations were found on palb2, chek2, and pms2 genes, respectively. the results demonstrate that the six-gene targeted ngs panel may provide an approach to assess the genetic risk of breast cancer and predict the clinical prognosis of breast cancer patients.	-1
protean pten: form and function.  germline mutations distributed across the pten tumor-suppressor gene have been found to result in a wide spectrum of phenotypic features. originally shown to be a major susceptibility gene for both cowden syndrome (cs), which is characterized by multiple hamartomas and an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancers, and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome, which is characterized by lipomatosis, macrocephaly, and speckled penis, the pten hamartoma tumor syndrome spectrum has broadened to include proteus syndrome and proteus-like syndromes. exon 5, which encodes the core motif, is a hotspot for mutations likely due to the biology of the protein. pten is a major lipid 3-phosphatase, which signals down the pi3 kinase/akt pro-apoptotic pathway. furthermore, pten is a protein phosphatase, with the ability to dephosphorylate both serine and threonine residues. the protein-phosphatase activity has also been shown to regulate various cell-survival pathways, such as the mitogen-activated kinase (mapk) pathway. although it is well established that pten's lipid-phosphatase activity, via the pi3k/akt pathway, mediates growth suppression, there is accumulating evidence that the protein-phosphatase/mapk pathway is equally important in the mediation of growth arrest and other crucial cellular functions.	1
dominant and recessive inheritance of morbid obesity associated with melanocortin 4 receptor deficiency.  over 20 severely obese subjects in 11 independent kindreds have been reported to have pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the melanocortin 4 receptor (mc4r), making this the most common known monogenic cause of human obesity. to date, the detailed clinical phenotype of this dominantly inherited disorder has not been defined, and no homozygous subjects have been described. we determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire coding region of the mc4r gene in 243 subjects with severe, early-onset obesity. a novel two-base pair gt insertion in codon 279 was found in two unrelated subjects, and four novel missense mutations, n62s, r165q, v253i, c271y, and one mutation (t112m) reported previously were found in five subjects. n62s was found in homozygous form in five children with severe obesity from a consanguineous pedigree. all four heterozygous carriers were nonobese. several features of the phenotype, e.g. hyperphagia, tendency toward tall stature, hyperinsulinemia, and preserved reproductive function, closely resemble those reported previously in mc4r knock-out mice. in addition, a marked increase in bone mineral density was seen in all affected subjects. in transient transfection assays, the n62s mutant receptor showed a responsiveness to alphamsh that was intermediate between the wild-type receptor and mutant receptors carrying nonsense and missense mutations associated with dominantly inherited obesity. thus mc4r mutations result in a syndrome of hyperphagic obesity in humans that can present with either dominant or recessive patterns of inheritance.	-1
gjb2 deafness gene shows a specific spectrum of mutations in japan, including a frequent founder mutation.  mutations in the gjb2 gene (connexin 26) are the major cause of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment in many populations. in contrast to the volume of information regarding the involvement of gjb2 mutations in hearing impairment in populations of european ancestry, less is known regarding other ethnic groups. in this study, we analyzed the gjb2 gene for mutations in 1227 hearing-impaired japanese individuals. this revealed a unique spectrum of gjb2 mutations, different from that found in the caucasian population. the most frequent mutation in japanese, 235delc, has never been reported in caucasians. to investigate a possible founder effect for the 235delc mutation, we analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms in the vicinity of the gjb2 gene. results were consistent with inheritance of the 235delc mutation from a common ancestor. the results of this study have important implications for genetic diagnostic testing for deafness in the japanese population.	-1
genotype, phenotype and disease severity reflected by serum lysogb3 levels in patients with fabry disease.  fabry disease (fd) is a rare x-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by mutations in the ?-galactosidase a (gla) gene causing deficiency of ?-galactosidase a which results in progressive glycosphingolipid accumulation, especially globotriaosylceramide (gb3), in body liquids and lysosomes. in a large cohort of fd patients, we aimed to establish genotype/phenotype relations as indicated by serum lysogb3 (deacylated gb3). in 69 consecutive adult fd patients (males: n=28 (41%)) with a gla-mutation confirmed diagnosis, we conducted a multidisciplinary clinical characterization during their routine annual examinations, and measured serum lysogb3 levels by high-sensitive electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. serum levels of lysogb3 were significantly higher in classic compared with later-onset phenotype and higher in the latter compared with controls, both in males (52 [40-83] vs 9.5 [4.5-20] vs 0.47 [0.41-0.61] ng/ml, p<0.001) and in females (9.9 [7.9-14] vs 4.9 [1.6-4.9] vs 0.41 [0.33-0.48] ng/ml, p<0.001), respectively. multivariate linear regression analysis showed that lysogb3 levels were independently associated with, serum creatinine (?=0.09, 95%ci 0.04-0.13, p<0.001) and the presence of cardiomyopathy (?=25, 95%ci 9.8-41, p=0.002). lysogb3 levels were higher in males with frame-shift and nonsense mutations than in males with missense mutations (84 [72-109] vs 41 [37-52] ng/ml, p=0.002). lysogb3 relates to disease severity, enzyme replacement response, and to the genotype severity in males. lysogb3 supports identifying patients at risk who require intensive monitoring and treatment. lysogb3 appears to be one marker of metabolic phenotyping of fd.	-1
gain-of-function sos1 mutations cause a distinctive form of noonan syndrome.  noonan syndrome is a developmental disorder characterized by short stature, facial dysmorphia, congenital heart defects and skeletal anomalies. increased ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) signaling due to ptpn11 and kras mutations causes 50% of cases of noonan syndrome. here, we report that 22 of 129 individuals with noonan syndrome without ptpn11 or kras mutation have missense mutations in sos1, which encodes a ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor. sos1 mutations cluster at codons encoding residues implicated in the maintenance of sos1 in its autoinhibited form. in addition, ectopic expression of two noonan syndrome-associated mutants induces enhanced ras and erk activation. the phenotype associated with sos1 defects lies within the noonan syndrome spectrum but is distinctive, with a high prevalence of ectodermal abnormalities but generally normal development and linear growth. our findings implicate gain-of-function mutations in a ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor in disease for the first time and define a new mechanism by which upregulation of the ras pathway can profoundly change human development.	1
identification of cdh1 germline missense mutations associated with functional inactivation of the e-cadherin protein in young gastric cancer probands.  e-cadherin is involved in the formation of cell-junctions and the maintenance of epithelial integrity. direct evidence of e-cadherin mutations triggering tumorigenesis has come from the finding of inactivating germline mutations of the gene (cdh1) in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc). we screened a series of 66 young gastric cancer probands for germline cdh1 mutations, and two novel missense alterations together with an intronic variant were identified. we then analysed the functional significance of the two exonic missense variants found here as well as a third germline missense variant that we previously identified in a hgdc family. cdnas encoding either the wild-type protein or mutant forms of e-cadherin were stably transfected into cho (chinese hamster ovary) e-cadherin-negative cells. transfected cell-lines were characterized in terms of aggregation, motility and invasion. we show that a proportion of apparently sporadic early-onset diffuse gastric carcinomas are associated with germline alterations of the e-cadherin gene. we also demonstrate that a proportion of missense variants are associated with significant functional consequences, suggesting that our cell model can be used as an adjunct in deciding on the potential pathogenic role of identified e-cadherin germline alterations.	1
novel mutation of the pten gene in an italian cowden's disease kindred.  cowden disease (cd) is an autosomal dominant multiple hamartoma syndrome with an elevated risk of thyroid and breast cancers. the cd susceptibility gene has recently been identified as the pten/mmac1/tep1 gene localized at 10q23 and coding for a dual specificity protein phosphatase. we report the mutational analysis of the pten gene in one italian cd kindred. by using the single strand conformation polymorphism technique and subsequent direct dna sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction product, we identified a novel mutation in the exon 5 of the pten gene. a heterozygous germline tgt-tat transition was detected at the nucleotide 407; this causes the amino acid substitution cys136-tyr136 and the generation of a new nsi i restriction site. this mutation was not detected in the unaffected member of the family thereby indicating that it is causally linked to the disease. we ruled out that this mutation is a polymorphic variant because it was not detected in over 100 chromosomes analyzed. using reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we detected the expression of the mutant allele in lymphocytes and pathological tissues from an affected member of the family.	-1
cardiac sodium channel dysfunction in sudden infant death syndrome.  mutations in genes responsible for the congenital long-qt syndrome, especially scn5a, have been identified in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome. in a large-scale collaborative genetic screen, several scn5a variants were identified in a norwegian sudden infant death syndrome cohort (n=201). we present functional characterization of 7 missense variants (s216l, r680h, t1304m, f1486l, v1951l, f2004l, and p2006a) and 1 in-frame deletion allele (delal586-587) identified by these efforts. whole-cell sodium currents were measured in tsa201 cells transiently transfected with recombinant wild-type or mutant scn5a cdna (hh1) coexpressed with the human beta1 subunit. all variants exhibited defects in the kinetics and voltage dependence of inactivation. five variants (s216l, t1304m, f1486l, f2004l, and p2006a) exhibited significantly increased persistent sodium currents (range, 0.5% to 1.7% of peak current) typical of scn5a mutations associated with long-qt syndrome. these same 5 variants also displayed significant depolarizing shifts in voltage dependence of inactivation (range, 5 to 14 mv) and faster recovery from inactivation, but f1486l uniquely exhibits a depolarizing shift in the conductance-voltage relationship. three alleles (delal586-587, r680h, and v1951l) exhibited increased persistent current only under conditions of internal acidosis (r680h) or when expressed in the context of a common splice variant (delq1077), indicating that they have a latent dysfunctional phenotype. our present results greatly expand the spectrum of functionally characterized scn5a variants associated with sudden infant death syndrome and provide further biophysical correlates of arrhythmia susceptibility in this syndrome.	1
functional investigations of hnf1a identify rare variants as risk factors for type 2 diabetes in the general population.  variants in hnf1a encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1? (hnf-1a) are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young form 3 (mody 3) and type 2 diabetes. we investigated whether functional classification of hnf1a rare coding variants can inform models of diabetes risk prediction in the general population by analyzing the effect of 27 hnf1a variants identified in well-phenotyped populations (n = 4,115). bioinformatics tools classified 11 variants as likely pathogenic and showed no association with diabetes risk (combined minor allele frequency [maf] 0.22%; odds ratio [or] 2.02; 95% ci 0.73-5.60; p = 0.18). however, a different set of 11 variants that reduced hnf-1a transcriptional activity to <60% of normal (wild-type) activity was strongly associated with diabetes in the general population (combined maf 0.22%; or 5.04; 95% ci 1.99-12.80; p = 0.0007). our functional investigations indicate that 0.44% of the population carry hnf1a variants that result in a substantially increased risk for developing diabetes. these results suggest that functional characterization of variants within mody genes may overcome the limitations of bioinformatics tools for the purposes of presymptomatic diabetes risk prediction in the general population.	1
loss-of-function mutations in mc4r are very rare in the greek severely obese adult population.  melanocortin-4 receptor (mc4r) loss-of-function mutations are the commonest genetic cause of human monogenic obesity, so far. the contribution of mc4r coding mutations to severe obesity in the high-obesity prone greek population has not been investigated to date. we determined the mc4r coding sequence of 510 obese and 469 lean control subjects of greek origin, and we estimated the prevalence and the penetrance on obesity of mc4r loss-of-function mutations. the functional impact of novel nonsynonymous variants detected was investigated in vitro. we found two novel synonymous mutations (l23l and i102i), four nonsynonymous mutations (t112m, s127l, n274s, and s295l), and two polymorphisms (v103i and i251l) previously described in literature. we also detected a novel mutation (l207v) in a severely obese 69-year-old female patient, although the mutation did not cosegregate with obesity in the corresponding pedigree and had no functional consequences on mc4r protein function. loss-of-function mutations represented 75% of all nonsynonymous rare mutations identified among lean carriers and only 25% among obese subjects (p = 0.0001). the prevalence of loss-of-function mutations was lower in the obese group than in lean control subjects (0.20 vs. 0.64%) but this difference was not significant. therefore, the estimated penetrance of deleterious mc4r mutations was very low (6.3%) in heterozygous greek carriers of mc4r loss-of-function mutations. our data suggest that mc4r loss-of-function mutations are rare in the greek population. mc4r genetic deficiency is unlikely to explain the high propensity to develop severe obesity in this specific population.	-1
functional analysis, using in vitro mutagenesis, of amino acids located in the phenylalanine hydroxylase active site.  the 3-dimensional structure determination of rat phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) has identified potentially important amino acids lining the active site cleft with the majority of these having hydrophobic side-chains including several with aromatic side chains. here we have analyzed the effect on rat pah enzyme kinetics of in vitro mutagenesis of a number of these amino acids lining the pah active site. mutation of f299, y324, f331, and y343 caused a significant decrease in enzyme activity but no change in the km for substrate or cofactor. we conclude that these aromatic residues are essential for activity but are not significantly involved in binding of the substrate or cofactor. in contrast the pah mutant, s349t, showed an 18-fold increase in km for phenylalanine, showing the first functional evidence that this residue was binding at or near the phenylalanine binding site. this confirms the recently published model for the binding of phenylalanine to the pah active site that postulated s349 interacts with the amino group on the main chain of the phenylalanine molecule. this result differs with that found for the equivalent mutation (s395t), in the closely related tyrosine hydroxylase, which had no effect on substrate km, showing that while the architecture of the two active sites are very similar the amino acids that bind to the respective substrates are different.	1
molecular analysis of slc26a4 gene in patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss and eva: identification of two novel mutations in brazilian patients.  the slc26a4 gene has been described as the second gene involved in most cases of sensorineural non-syndromic hearing loss, since the first is the gjb2 gene. recessive mutations in the slc26a4 gene encoding pendrin, an anion transporter, are responsible for non-syndromic hearing loss associated with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) and pendred syndrome, which causes early hearing loss and affects the thyroid gland. typically, the hearing loss is profound and prelingual. however, in some individuals, hearing impairment may develop later in childhood and then progress. over 200 different slc26a4 mutations have been reported, with each ethnic population having its own distinctive mutant allele series including a few prevalent founder mutations. perform the screening of the 20 coding exons of slc26a4 gene in brazilian deaf individuals with eva. among the 23 unrelated non-syndromic hearing loss brazilian patients with eva, in whom no deafness-causing mutations of the gjb2 gene, the direct sequencing was performed to screen the 20 exons and their flanking regions of the slc26a4 gene. the sequencing results revealed 9 cases (39%) carrying 13 different slc26a4 mutations, including 11 known mutations (279delt, v138f, t193i, ivs8+1g>a, t410m, q413r, r409h, l445w, ivs15+5g>a, v609g, and r776c) and 2 novel mutation (g149r and p142l). the slc26a4 mutations have a high carrying rate in non-syndromic hearing loss brazilian patients. the identification of a disease-causing mutation can be used to establish a genotypic diagnosis and provide important information to the patients and their families.	-1
nature and frequency of mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene that cause fabry disease.  fabry disease, an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a) gene at xq22.1. to determine the nature and frequency of the molecular lesions causing the classical and milder-variant fabry phenotypes, and for precise carrier detection in fabry families, the alpha-gal a transcripts or genomic sequences from unrelated fabry hemizygotes were analyzed. in patients with the classical phenotype, 18 new mutations were identified: n34s, c56g, w162r, r227q, r227x, d264v, d266v, s297f, d313y, g328a, w340x, e398x, ivs2+2, ivs5 delta-2,3, 773 delta 2, 954 delta 5, 1016 delta 11, and 1123 delta 53. unrelated asymptomatic or mildly affected patients with symptoms confined to the heart had a missense mutation, n215s, that expressed residual enzymatic activity. related, moderately affected patients with late-onset cardiac and pulmonary manifestations had a small deletion, 1208 delta 3, that predicted the in-frame deletion of arginine 404 near the terminus of the 429 residue enzyme polypeptide. in addition, five small gene rearrangements involving exonic sequences were identified in unrelated classically affected patients. two small deletions and one small duplication had short direct repeats at their respective breakpoint junctions and presumably resulted from slipped mispairing. a deletion occurred at a potential polymerase alpha arrest site, while the breakpoints of another deletion occurred at an inverted tetranucleotide repeat. screening of unrelated fabry patients with allele-specific oligonucleotides for seven mutations revealed that these were private, with the notable exception of n215s, r227q, and r227x, which were each found in several unrelated families from different ethnic backgrounds. the cpg dinucleotide at codon 227 was the most common site of mutation, having been altered in 5% of the 148 unrelated fabry alleles. these studies revealed that most alpha-gal a lesions were private, that codon 227 was a mutational hot spot, and that certain mutations predicted a milder disease phenotype.	-1
spectrum and frequency of slc26a4 mutations among czech patients with early hearing loss with and without enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva).  mutations in slc26a4 cause pendred syndrome (ps) - hearing loss with goitre - or dfnb4 - non-syndromic hearing loss (nshl) with inner ear abnormalities such as enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) or mondini dysplasia (md). we tested 303 unrelated czech patients with early hearing loss (298 with nshl and 5 with ps), all gjb2-negative, for slc26a4 mutations and evaluated their clinical and radiological phenotype. among 115 available hrct/mri scans we detected three md (2.6%), three mondini-like affections (2.6%), 16 eva (13 bilateral - 19.2% and 15.6% respectively) and 61 eva/md-negative scans (73.4%). we found mutation(s) in 26 patients (8.6%) and biallelic mutations in eight patients (2.7%) out of 303 tested. in 18 of 26 (69%) patients, no second mutation could be detected even using mlpa. the spectrum of slc26a4 mutations in czech patients is broad without any prevalent mutation. we detected 21 different mutations (four novel). the most frequent mutations were p.val138phe and p.leu445trp (18% and 8.9% of pathogenic alleles respectively). among 13 patients with bilateral eva, six patients (50%) carry biallelic mutations. in eva -negative patients no biallelic mutations were found but 4.9% had monoallelic mutations. slc26a4 mutations are present mostly in patients with eva/md and/or progressive hl and those with affected siblings.	-1
sleep disordered breathing in childhood-onset acid maltase deficiency.  to clarify the feature of sleep disordered breathing (sdb) associated with childhood-onset acid maltase deficiency (amd): the progressive nature of sdb and the stage of amd. we retrospectively studied 4 patients with childhood-onset amd by analyzing the results of neurological examinations for muscle wasting and muscle strength and the data on venous gas and from a pulmonary function test and nocturnal polysomnography (psg). three out of the 4 patients showed muscular symptoms including myalgia, lordoscoliosis, muscle wasting and muscle weakness. they also complained of sleep-related symptoms such as tiredness in the morning and daytime sleepiness. all of them showed sdb by psg, even in a patient in the earliest stage who exhibited no signs or symptoms of muscle weakness. in 3 patients, noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation during sleep was introduced; and thereafter sleep-related symptoms were resolved and no lower respiratory infection reoccurred. although their quality of life was improved, no improvement of respiratory function was shown by spirometry over a 2-year follow-up period. sdb seems to be common in childhood-onset amd, which is not always accompanied by daytime muscular symptoms, especially in mild patients. psg should be utilized for detecting sdb, which could be one of the earliest signs of respiratory muscle involvement in childhood-onset amd.	-1
development of a clinical assay for detection of gaa mutations and characterization of the gaa mutation spectrum in a canadian cohort of individuals with glycogen storage disease, type ii.  glycogen storage disease, type ii (gsdii; pompe disease; acid maltase deficiency) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations of the gaa gene that lead to deficient acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity and accumulation of lysosomal glycogen. although measurement of acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity in fibroblasts remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of gsdii, analysis of the gaa gene allows confirmation of clinical or biochemical diagnoses and permits predictive and prenatal testing of individuals at risk of developing gsdii. we have developed a clinical molecular test for the detection of gaa mutations based on cycle sequencing of the complete coding region. gaa exons 2-20 are amplified in six independent pcr using intronic primers. the resulting products were purified and sequenced. preliminary studies using this protocol were conducted with dna from 21 gsdii-affected individuals from five centers across canada. in total, 41 of 42 mutations were detected (96.7% detection rate). mutations spanned intron 1 through exon 19 and included nine novel mutations. haplotype analysis of recurrent mutations further suggested that three of these mutations are likely to have occurred independently at least twice. additionally, we report the identification of the c.-32-13t>g gaa mutation in an individual with infantile variant gsdii, despite reports of this mutation being associated almost exclusively with late-onset forms of the disease. the development of a clinical molecular test provides an important tool for the management and counseling of families and individuals with gsdii, and has provided useful information about the gaa mutation spectrum in canada.	-1
clinical laboratory experience of blood crim testing in infantile pompe disease.  cross-reactive immunological material (crim) status is an important prognostic factor in patients with infantile pompe disease (ipd) being treated with enzyme replacement therapy. western blot analysis of cultured skin fibroblast lysates has been the gold standard for determining crim status. here, we evaluated crim status using peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) protein. for 6 of 33 patients (18%) crim status determination using pbmc was either indeterminate or discordant with gaa genotype or fibroblast crim analysis results. while the use of pbmcs for crim determination has the advantage of a faster turnaround time, further evaluation is needed to ensure the accuracy of crim results.	-1
differences in clinical expression of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with two distinct mutations in the beta-myosin heavy chain gene. a 908leu----val mutation and a 403arg----gln mutation.  the disease gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) has been identified as the beta-myosin heavy chain (beta-mhc) gene in some hcm families. we describe extensive clinical evaluations in two kindreds with two distinct point mutations in the beta-mhc gene. we used single-strand confirmation polymorphism (sscp) gel analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified products capturing each of the 40 beta-mhc gene exons to identify distinct missense mutations in two hcm kindreds. clinical, ecg, and echocardiographic studies were performed in the two kindreds: kindred 2755 with amino acid 908leu----val mutation and kindred 2002 with amino acid 403arg----gln mutation. the morphological appearances of hcm were similar in these two kindreds. however, the two kindreds differed with respect to disease penetrance, age of onset of disease, and incidence of premature sudden death. twelve of 31 adults (greater than or equal to 17 years) with the disease gene in kindred 2755 did not have left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh), and only five of these had ecg abnormalities. thus, the disease penetrance in adults with this mutation was only 61%. none of 11 children aged less than 16 years had lvh. the 908 mutation was associated with a low incidence of cardiac events: only two sudden deaths and one syncope occurred in 46 individuals with the mutant allele. in contrast, lvh was present in all 11 adults in kindred 2002 with the 403 mutation (100% disease penetrance). in addition, three of four affected children were symptomatic and had clinical evidence of hcm. the disease in this kindred was severe and resulted in six premature sudden deaths. seven additional patients had syncope or presyncope. in some kindreds, the hcm disease gene is more prevalent than indicated by echocardiography and ecg. some point mutations may be associated with a more malignant prognosis. preclinical identification of children with mutations associated with a high incidence of sudden death and syncope provides the opportunity to evaluate efficacy of early therapeutic interventions.	-1
abnormal distribution and hyperplasia of thyroid c-cells in pten-associated tumor syndromes.  cowden's disease (cd) and bannayan-ruvalcaba-riley syndrome (brrs) are allelic disorders characterized by multiple hamartomatous overgrowths of the thyroid, breast, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, and an increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors of the breast and thyroid gland, secondary to germline point mutations in the pten gene. in contrast to thyroid epithelial lesions, abnormalities of the c-cells are currently not considered part of the spectrum of manifestations seen in pten-associated syndromes. the thyroid glands from two patients with overlapping cd/brrs phenotypes, and with distinct pten mutations, were entirely submitted for histopathological examination, calcitonin immunostaining and c-cell mapping. multiple follicular adenomas and adenomatous nodules were present in the thyroid glands from both patients. a microscopic focus of papillary carcinoma was also present in one gland. c-cell hyperplasia was documented in both cases by calcitonin immunostaining. pten-associated tumor syndromes should be considered in the differential diagnosis of c-cell hyperplasia of the thyroid.	-1
[novel mutations identified in exon 7 of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene in chinese].  exon 7 of the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene was analyzed in 45 children affected with classic phenylketonuria (pku) from northern china by using pcr-single strand conformation polymorphism (pcr-sscp) technique and dna direct sequencing. six missense mutations (i.e. r243q, r241h, g247v, l249h, p254i and g257v) and one silent mutation (v245v) were identified. the latter three missense mutations were demonstrated as novel mutations in comparison with the pah mutation database. one missense mutation (r241h) was first documented in chinese. our results showed population and regional differences in the pah mutation distribution and suggest that there is more than one founding population for pku in china. the finding of novel mutations will enhance our capability in molecular diagnosis of pku.	-1
skeletal muscle metabolism during prolonged exercise in pompe disease.  pompe disease (glycogenosis type ii) is caused by lysosomal alpha-glucosidase deficiency, which leads to a block in intra-lysosomal glycogen breakdown. in spite of enzyme replacement therapy, pompe disease continues to be a progressive metabolic myopathy. considering the health benefits of exercise, it is important in pompe disease to acquire more information about muscle substrate use during exercise. seven adults with pompe disease were matched to a healthy control group (1:1). we determined (1) peak oxidative capacity (vo<sub>2peak</sub>) and (2) carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism during submaximal exercise (33 w) for 1 h, using cycle-ergometer exercise, indirect calorimetry and stable isotopes. in the patients, vo<sub>2peak</sub> was less than half of average control values; mean difference -1659 ml/min (ci: -2450 to -867, <i>p</i> = 0.001). however, the respiratory exchange ratio increased to >1.0 and lactate levels rose 5-fold in the patients, indicating significant glycolytic flux. in line with this, during submaximal exercise, the rates of oxidation (rox) of carbohydrates and palmitate were similar between patients and controls (mean difference 0.226 g/min (ci: 0.611 to -0.078, <i>p</i> = 0.318) and mean difference 0.016 mol/kg/min (ci: 1.287 to -1.255, <i>p</i> = 0.710), respectively). reflecting muscle weakness and wasting, pompe disease is associated with markedly reduced maximal exercise capacity. however, glycogenolysis is not impaired in exercise. unlike in other metabolic myopathies, skeletal muscle substrate use during exercise is normal in pompe disease rendering exercise less complicated for e.g. medical or recreational purposes.	-1
[clinical features and acid alpha-glucosidase gene mutation in 7 chinese patients with glycogen storage disease type ii].  to explore the clinical features and acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) gene mutations of chinese patients with glycogen storage disease typeii(gsdii). seven patients with gsdii were diagnosed by muscle pathology examination at department of neurology, peking university first hospital from 2003 to 2011. one patient with infant-onset presented development retardation, generalized muscle weakness, dyspnea, cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly. six cases were of late-onset ranging from 1 to 29 years. their main clinical features included progressive muscle weakness. two patients developed respiratory insufficiency. increased serum creatine kinase was detected in all of them. electromyography studies showed myopathic (n = 5) and neuropathic (n = 1) changes. muscle biopsies showed basophilic vacuoles in muscle fibers containing a large amounts of glycogen on electron microscopy. gaa gene mutation was detected by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) product. novel mutations were screened in 100 normal controls. gaa gene mutations were found in all of them, including 10 point mutations and 1 frameshift deletion. six mutations (p. p361l, p. p266s, p.r437c, p.r600c, p.w746s and p.w746*) have been reported before. and five novel mutations (p.r168q, p.r168p, p.e521v, p.r594h and c.827_845del) were found in this study. none of these novel mutations were found in 100 normal controls except for p.r168q mutation in two normal controls. p. p361l and p.w746* were detected in two unrelated gsdii patients while other mutations were carried by only one patient. in our study, we found several novel gaa mutations in chinese patients with gsdii. no hot spot mutation of gaa gene existed in our patient group. however, p. p266s, p. p361l and p.r437c might be associated with late-onset gsdii.	-1
"transcriptional control of slc26a4 is involved in pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (dfnb4).  although recessive mutations in the anion transporter gene slc26a4 are known to be responsible for pendred syndrome (ps) and nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva), also known as ""dfnb4,"" a large percentage of patients with this phenotype lack mutations in the slc26a4 coding region in one or both alleles. we have identified and characterized a key transcriptional regulatory element in the slc26a4 promoter that binds foxi1, a transcriptional activator of slc26a4. in nine patients with ps or nonsyndromic eva, a novel c.-103t-->c mutation in this regulatory element interferes with foxi1 binding and completely abolishes foxi1-mediated transcriptional activation. we have also identified six patients with mutations in foxi1 that compromise its ability to activate slc26a4 transcription. in one family, the eva phenotype segregates in a double-heterozygous mode in the affected individual who carries single mutations in both slc26a4 and foxi1. this finding is consistent with our observation that eva occurs in the slc26a4(+/-); foxi1(+/-) double-heterozygous mouse mutant. these results support a novel dosage-dependent model for the molecular pathogenesis of ps and nonsyndromic eva that involves slc26a4 and its transcriptional regulatory machinery."	1
z-band alternatively spliced pdz motif protein (zasp) is the major o-linked ?-n-acetylglucosamine-substituted protein in human heart myofibrils.  we studied o-linked ?-n-acetylglucosamine (o-glcnac) modification of contractile proteins in human heart using sds-page and three detection methods: specific enzymatic conjugation of o-glcnac with udp-n-azidoacetylgalactosamine (udp-galnaz) that is then linked to a tetramethylrhodamine fluorescent tag and ctd110.6 and rl2 monoclonal antibodies to o-glcnac. all three methods showed that o-glcnac modification was predominantly in a group of bands ~90 kda that did not correspond to any of the major myofibrillar proteins. maldi-ms/ms identified the 90-kda band as the protein zasp (z-band alternatively spliced pdz motif protein), a minor component of the z-disc (about 1 per 400 ?-actinin) important for myofibrillar development and mechanotransduction. this was confirmed by the co-localization of o-glcnac and zasp in western blotting and by immunofluorescence microscopy. o-glcnacylation of zasp increased in diseased heart, being 49  5% of all o-glcnac in donor, 68  9% in end-stage failing heart, and 76  6% in myectomy muscle samples (donor versus myectomy p < 0.05). zasp is only 22% of all o-glcnacylated proteins in mouse heart myofibrils.	-1
ush2a mutation analysis in 70 dutch families with usher syndrome type ii.  usher syndrome type ii (ush2) is characterised by moderate to severe high-frequency hearing impairment, progressive visual loss due to retinitis pigmentosa and intact vestibular responses. three loci are known for ush2, however, only the gene for ush2a (ush2a) has been identified. mutation analysis of ush2a was performed in 70 dutch ush2 families. ten mutations in ush2a were detected, of which three are novel, c.949c>a, c.2242c>t (p.gln748x) and c.4405c>t (p.gln1468x). including 9 previously published dutch ush2a families, estimates of the prevalence of ush2a in the dutch ush2 population were made. mutations were identified in 62% of the families. in 28% both mutated alleles were identified, whereas in 34% the mutation in only one allele was found. it is estimated that about 28% of the dutch ush2 families have a different causative gene. analysis of deduced haplotypes suggests that c.1256g>t (p.cys419phe) is a dutch ancestral mutation, occurring in 16% of the alleles.	-1
mutations of the pds gene, encoding pendrin, are associated with protein mislocalization and loss of iodide efflux: implications for thyroid dysfunction in pendred syndrome.  pendred syndrome (pds) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by deafness and goiter. phenotypic heterogeneity is observed in affected individuals, and thyroid dysfunction is particularly variable. the syndrome is caused by mutations in the pds (slc26a4) gene, encoding an anion transporter pendrin, which localizes to the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells. pds is thought to enable efflux iodide into the follicle lumen. more than 50 diseases causing mutations of pds have been reported. here we have investigated the effect of nine pds missense mutations on pendrin localization and iodide transport with the view to understanding their functional impact. as demonstrated by transient expression of green fluorescent protein-tagged pendrin mutant constructs in mammalian cell lines, appropriate trafficking to the plasma membrane was observed for only two mutants. the remaining pds mutants appear to be retained within the endoplasmic reticulum following transfection. iodide efflux assays were performed using human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with mutant pendrin and cotransfected with sodium iodide transporter to provide a mechanism of iodide uptake. the results indicated loss of pendrin iodide transport for all mislocalizing mutations. however, pds mutants are associated with variable thyroid dysfunction in affected subjects. we concluded that additional genetic and/or environmental factors influence the thyroid activity in pendred syndrome.	1
molecular analysis of phenylketonuria (pku) in newborns from texas.  this study describes the mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus in patients with the diagnosis of classic pku (n=18), hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) variant (n=9) and benign persistent hyperphenylalaninemia (hpa) (n=13) who were identified by the texas newborn screening program. blinded studies were done by sequencing of the 13 exons and exon-intron boundaries of the pah gene in genomic dna isolated from dry blood spots. thirty-six different mutations, including 25 missense mutations, six splice mutations, three deletions and two nonsense mutations were detected in 75 of the 80 mutant alleles (94%). the prevalent mutations were r408w (19%), v388m and ivs10nt-11g->a (6% each), y414c (5%) and h170d, a403v, t380m and ivs7nt1g->a (4% each). two novel missense mutations were identified in exon 5 (h170d and n167s). there was genotype/phenotype correlation in 33/40 cases (83%). for this population, exons 12, 11, 7, 5 and 8, which carry 78% of the mutations, would have to be screened first. however, the other exons must be studied when either one or no mutations are found in the primary screening. hum mutat 17:523, 2001.	-1
the use of targeted exome sequencing in genetic diagnosis of young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is an autosomal dominant disorder. although genetic testing is an important tool for detecting fh-causing mutations in patients, diagnostic methods for young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia are understudied. this study compares the target exome sequencing (tes) technique with the dna resequencing array technique on young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia. a total of 20 unrelated patients (mean age 14.8 years) with total cholesterol > 10 mmol/l were included. 12 patient samples were processed by dna resequencing array, 14 patient samples were processed by tes, and 6 patient samples were processed by both methods. functional characterization of novel mutations was performed by flow cytometry. the mutation detection rate (mdr) of dna resequencing array was 75%, while the mdr of tes was 100%. a total of 27 different mutations in the ldlr were identified, including 3 novel mutations and 8 mutations with previously unknown pathogenicity. functional characterization of c.673dela, c.1363delc, p.leu575phe and p.leu582phe variants found that all of them are pathogenic. additionally, 7 patients were diagnosed with heterozygous fh (hefh) in which lipid levels were significantly higher than common hefh patients. this data indicates that tes is a very efficient tool for genetic diagnosis in young patients with severe hypercholesterolemia.	1
ethylmalonic encephalopathy. another patient from kuwait.  we report a kuwaiti girl with ethylmalonic encephalopathy. she presented at the age of 4 months with chronic mucoid diarrhea and delayed psychomotor development, and at 6 months she developed myoclonic epilepsy. she was found to have central hypotonia with pyramidal tract signs, acrocyanosis, and petechiae. plasma lactate level was elevated. blood spot and urine for organic acids results were consistent with the diagnosis of ethylmalonic encephalopathy. cerebral mri showed basal ganglia and white matter changes. gene mutation study revealed homozygous deletion of exon 4 of the ethe1 gene. the patient died at 14 months after extensive bronchopneumonia. our objective is to alert physicians to the existence of such a devastating disease in our community and their role in the early diagnosis in the index patient for proper genetic counseling.	-1
detection of mutations and large rearrangements of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene in taiwanese patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.  familial hypercholesterolemia (fh) is commonly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr), apolipoprotein b, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. the study aim was to investigate patients with fh in taiwan, using molecular diagnostic methods, and compare the abnormalities in the small mutation and large dna rearrangement subgroups. in total, 102 unrelated probands with fh were tested for mutations by exon-by-exon sequence analysis (ebesa) and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa). ebesa identified gene apolipoprotein b r3500w in 8 probands and 25 mis-sense, 5 nonsense, and 6 frameshift ldlr mutations in 52 probands; 11 were novel mutations. of the 42 probands with mutations undetected by ebesa, 8 had abnormal mlpa patterns, including 2 with exon 6 to 18 deletions, 2 with exon 9 deletion, 1 with exon 6 to 8 deletions, 1 with exon 11 deletion, 1 with exon 3 to 5 duplications, and 1 with exon 7 to 12 duplications. pedigree analysis showed mutation cosegregation with hypercholesterolemia in affected family members. mean lipid profiles and rate of failure to lower ldl cholesterol <100 mg/dl in response to rosuvastatin/ezetimibe treatment were similar in groups with abnormal mlpa patterns and groups carrying nonsense or frameshift mutations. in conclusion, frequency of large ldlr rearrangement was approximately 8% in taiwanese patients with fh. the response to statin drugs differed between probands with abnormal mlpa patterns and probands carrying mis-sense or undetected mutations.	-1
a comprehensive study of tp53 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: analysis of 1287 diagnostic and 1148 follow-up cll samples.  tp53 plays a pivotal role in the process of dna repair and apoptosis. in 10-20% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll), the tp53 pathway is affected. in this study, we analyzed the tp53 mutation status in 2435 consecutive cll samples, including 1287 diagnostic samples and 1148 samples during follow-up, using fasay (functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast) and direct sequencing. in a cohort of 1287 diagnostic cll samples, we identified 237 cases with tp53 variants, including mutations, temperature-sensitive variants, deletions, insertions and aberrant splicing variants (18.4%). in 1148 follow-up samples, no tp53 clonal evolution was observed.	1
characterization of mutations in the low density lipoprotein (ldl)-receptor gene in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and frequency of these mutations in fh patients in the united kingdom.  mutations in the gene for the low density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor have been identified in 15 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). five patients are homozygous at the ldl-receptor locus; their mutant alleles include glu387lys and pro664leu in patients of asian-indian descent, cys292stop in a greek cypriot, cys281trp in a turkish patient, and gln 540stop in a west indian. the other 10 patients (9 of apparently british ancestry) are compound heterozygotes. mutations have been identified in 18 of 20 possible alleles, including glu80lys (2 patients), pro664leu (3 patients), asp69gly, cys176arg, cys227tyr, ser265arg, asp280ala, asp283glu, arg329pro, asp461asn, leu578ser, a single bp deletion in exon 15, a 21 bp duplication of codons 200-206 and two large deletions. the seven mutations underlined above have not been described previously. the two uncharacterized mutant alleles fail to produce detectable amounts of mrna. ldl-receptor activity in cultured cells from 13 of the 15 homozygous patients varied from undetectable to about 30% of normal, but there was no correlation between ldl-receptor activity and the untreated plasma cholesterol concentration in these patients. when genomic dna from 295 patients with a clinical diagnosis of fh was screened for 29 mutations found in these and other fh patients of british ancestry, most were identified in only one or a few individuals. four patients heterozygous for the asp461asn allele showed a wide range of clinical manifestations. these observations confirm the striking heterogeneity underlying fh in most populations and demonstrate the variability in phenotype between patients with the same mutation.	-1
prognostic factors for the late onset pompe disease with enzyme replacement therapy: from our experience of 4 cases including an autopsy case.  we report 4 cases of late onset glycogen storage disease type ii (gsd ii) or pompe disease (omim #232300), under enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human acid alpha glucosidase (rh-gaa, omim *606800). in these 4 cases, we focused on the case of a 28-years-old man, whose condition at the ert starting was the worst and resulted in poor prognosis. the autopsy was done under his family's permission, and revealed severe accumulation of glycogen in his muscle, especially diaphragm or iliopsoas, and pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (pvod) which resulted in severe pulmonary hypertension (ph). this is the first report of pvod as the cause of ph in pompe disease. we studied this case comparing to another 3 cases of late onset pompe disease under the same course of ert in our hospital, and the average data of the group of late onset pompe disease with severe pulmonary insufficiency receiving ert, supposed that low score of the body mass index (bmi) on the baseline, the presence of specific genotype (p.r600c), and signs of pulmonary dysfunction suggesting ph (tachypnea, ultrasound cardiography data) were factors that influenced the prognosis. for a better prognosis in the late onset pompe disease, an early diagnosis for the early start of ert before the onset of respiratory failure should be important, and the deliberate management and care should be needed even after the ert start, especially for severe cases including pulmonary dysfunction.	-1
effects of enzyme replacement therapy on five patients with advanced late-onset glycogen storage disease type ii: a 2-year follow-up study.  we examined the efficacy of 2-year enzyme replacement therapy (ert) using recombinant human ?-glucosidase (gaa; myozyme) in five long-term ventilator-dependent adults and aged patients with advanced, late-onset glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii, also known as pompe disease). although all patients had advanced respiratory failure and were ventilator-dependent for more than 6 years, four showed obvious improvements in muscle strength, pulmonary function, and activities of daily living after ert. improvement in each parameter was more prominent in the first year than in the second year. values in the second year were still significantly better than those at study entry and indicate stabilization in the clinical status of all patients. these results suggest that ert continues to be effective in the second year of treatment even in patients suffering from advanced late-onset gsdii disease with severe respiratory failure.	-1
loss of function in phenylketonuria is caused by impaired molecular motions and conformational instability.  a significant share of patients with phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) deficiency benefits from pharmacological doses of tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)), the natural pah cofactor. phenylketonuria (pku) is hypothesized to be a conformational disease, with loss of function due to protein destabilization, and the restoration of enzyme function that is observed in bh(4) treatment might be transmitted by correction of protein misfolding. to elucidate the molecular basis of functional impairment in pah deficiency, we investigated the impact of ten pah gene mutations identified in patients with bh(4)-responsiveness on enzyme kinetics, stability, and conformation of the protein (f55l, i65s, h170q, p275l, a300s, s310y, p314s, r408w, y414c, y417h). residual enzyme activity was generally high, but allostery was disturbed in almost all cases and pointed to altered protein conformation. this was confirmed by reduced proteolytic stability, impaired tetramer assembly or aggregation, increased hydrophobicity, and accelerated thermal unfolding--with particular impact on the regulatory domain--observed in most variants. three-dimensional modeling revealed the involvement of functionally relevant amino acid networks that may communicate misfolding throughout the protein. our results substantiate the view that pah deficiency is a protein-misfolding disease in which global conformational changes hinder molecular motions essential for physiological enzyme function. thus, pku has evolved from a model of a genetic disease that leads to severe neurological impairment to a model of a treatable protein-folding disease with loss of function.	1
long-term follow-up of r403wmyh7 and r92wtnnt2 hcm families: mutations determine left ventricular dimensions but not wall thickness during disease progression.  the clinical profile and prognosis of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a primary cardiac muscle disease caused mostly by mutations in sarcomeric protein-encoding genes, have been linked to particular disease-causing mutations in the past. however, such associations are often based on cross-sectional observations, as longitudinal studies of the progression of the disease in genotypically defined patients are sparse. most importantly, the relative contribution of age, gender and genetic cause to disease profile and progression has not yet been reported, and the question remains whether one or more of these factors could mask the effect of the other(s). we previously described cross-sectional family studies of two hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm)-causing mutations, r92w(tnnt2) and r403w(myh7), both associated with minimal hypertrophy, but with widely different life expectancies. we re-investigated 22 and 26 r92w(tnnt2) and r403w(myh7) mutation carriers in these and additional south african r92w(tnnt2) families after a mean 11.08 +/- 2.79 years, and compared the influence of the two mutations, in the context of age and gender, on disease progression. we demonstrated a positive correlation between age and interventricular septal thickness for both mutations, with more than a third of all mutation carriers developing clinically recognised hypertrophy only after the age of 35 years. this period of hypertrophically silent hcm also coincided with the years in which most sudden cardiac deaths occurred, particularly in male r92w(tnnt2) carriers. statistical analyses indicated that the particular mutation was the strongest determinant of left ventricular remodelling; particularly, lvesd increased and ef reduction was noted in the majority of r403w(myh7) carriers, which may require clinical follow-up over the longer term. statistical modelling of follow-up data suggests that an interplay between unidentified, possibly gender-associated factors, and the causal mutation are the determinants of eventual cardiac function and survival, but not of the extent of hypertrophy, and emphasises the need for long-term follow-up even in individuals with apparently mild disease.	-1
infantile-onset pompe disease: a case series highlighting early clinical features, spectrum of disease severity and treatment response.  pompe disease is a rare, autosomal, recessive disorder. alterations in the gene encoding lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase cause impaired glycogen degradation and resultant lysosomal glycogen accumulation. classic infantile-onset pompe disease (ipd) manifests soon after birth, severe cases have complete/near complete enzyme deficiency. ipd is associated with a broad spectrum of non-specific clinical features, and diagnostic delays are common. without treatment, death typically occurs within the first 2 years of life. we present case experiences to help expand paediatricians' understanding of factors contributing to diagnostic delay, clinical decline and to highlight the need for timely therapy. data were extracted from ipd cases managed at our hospital. key aspects of clinical presentation, diagnosis, genetic variations, management and overall outcomes were collated then compared with what is already known in the literature. we report four ipd cases (three female). two patients were cross-reactive immunological material negative. age at symptom onset was 3-9 months, presenting clinical features were varied, and confirmatory diagnosis was significantly delayed in one patient. in concert with the literature, cardiomegaly, ventricular hypertrophy and delayed developmental milestones were seen in all four cases. our cases demonstrate a range of disease severity, response to enzyme replacement therapy and antibody development. significant immune responses were seen in two cases (one cross-reactive immunological material positive); despite immunomodulation therapy, both were associated with fatal outcomes. timely diagnosis and initiation of enzyme replacement therapy is critical to patient outcomes as ipd progresses rapidly and irreversible changes in clinical status may occur during the delay.	1
high frequency of de novo mutations in li-fraumeni syndrome.  li-fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by germline mutations in the tp53 gene. the frequency of germline de novo tp53 mutations is largely unknown; few unequivocal de novo mutations have been reported. of 341 patients with early onset cancer sent for clinical testing to a national reference laboratory, 75 patients had tp53 germline mutations. five (7%) de novo mutations were identified, as well as an additional 10 tp53 germline mutations likely to be de novo by family history. the frequency of de novo tp53 mutations in this patient sample is at least 7% and may be as high as 20%. the possibility that de novo germline tp53 mutations are relatively common has implications for testing and the identification of potential li-fraumeni syndrome in patients with little or no family history of cancer.	-1
structural and functional effects of disease-causing amino acid substitutions affecting residues ala72 and glu76 of the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp-2.  mutations of the protein tyrosine phosphatase shp-2 are implicated in human diseases, causing noonan syndrome (ns) and related developmental disorders or contributing to leukemogenesis depending on the specific amino acid substitution involved. shp-2 is composed by a catalytic (ptp) and two regulatory (n-sh2 and c-sh2) domains that bind to signaling partners and control the enzymatic activity by limiting the accessibility of the catalytic site. wild type shp-2 and four disease-associated mutants recurring in hematologic malignancies (glu76lys and ala72val) or causing ns (glu76asp and ala72ser), with affected residues located in the ptp-interacting region of the n-sh2 domain, were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro biochemical assays. simulations demonstrate that mutations do not affect significantly the conformation of the n-sh2 domain. rather they destabilize the interaction of this domain with the catalytic site, with more evident effects in the two leukemia associated mutants. consistent with this structural evidence, mutants exhibit an increased level of basal phosphatase activity in the order glu76lys > ala72val > glu76asp > ala72ser > wt. the experimental data also show that the mutants with higher basal activity are more responsive to an activating phosphopeptide. a thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that an increase in the overall phosphopeptide affinity of mutants can be explained by a shift in the equilibrium between the inactive and active shp-2 structure. these data support the view that an increase in the affinity of shp-2 for its binding partners, caused by destabilization of the closed, inactive conformation, rather than protein basal activation per se, would represent the molecular mechanism, leading to pathogenesis in these mutants.	1
the molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in the netherlands.  mutations in the low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor gene are responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia (fh). at present, more than 600 mutations in this gene are known to underlie fh. however, the array of mutations varies considerably in different populations. therefore, the delineation of essentially all ldl-receptor gene mutations in a population is a prerequisite for the implementation of nation-wide genetic testing for fh. in the netherlands, mutation analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing in 1641 clinically diagnosed fh patients resulted in the characterization of 159 different ldl-receptor gene defects. the nine most common mutations were responsible for 66.5% of our fh index cases. of these, four mutations occurred with relatively high frequencies in specific parts of the netherlands. the remaining mutations were only encountered in single fh patients, comprising 22.2% of the patient cohort analyzed. subsequent genetic testing of relatives of the index cases within the national fh screening program resulted in the identification of 5,531 fh patients in total. the analysis for ldl-receptor mutations is a continuing effort to update the ldl-receptor mutation catalogue. subsequently, with the newly generated index cases, the screening program can be extended and continued to identify and treat fh patients as early as possible and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients at high risk.	-1

genetic epidemiological study doesn't support gla ivs4+919g>a variant is a significant mutation in fabry disease.  the gla ivs4+919g>a which is linked to late-onset fabry disease shows high frequency in taiwan. to determine whether ivs4+919g>a is a frequent cause of heart disease, we genotyped it in normal controls and other disease cohorts (type 2 diabetes, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease). normal controls and diabetes patients carrying the variant were evaluated for their cardiac condition. minigene constructs were used to study gla splicing patterns in different cell lines. gla ivs4+919a was found in 4/1634 males (0.245%) and 2/1634 females (0.123%) in normal controls and in 4/2133 males (0.188%) and 7/1816 females (0.385%) in the type 2 diabetes cohort. of all the 17 ivs4+919a carriers in these two groups, only two males reported heart-related disease (myocardial infarction and hypertensive heart disease). furthermore, in the heart disease cohort (n=649), only one male carried the variant. minigene constructs showed that the ags (stomach) cell line showed a distinct gla splicing pattern. most subjects carrying gla ivs4+919a did not show abnormal cardiac phenotypes. the near-absence of gla ivs4+919a in heart disease cohort suggested that this variant is not a frequent cause of overt heart diseases in taiwan and that the genotype-phenotype correlation and natural course of the disease need further investigation. we also showed that the gla ivs4+919g>a nucleotide change did influence alternative splicing in a tissue-specific manner. the gla ivs4+919g>a variant is not a frequent cause of overt heart disease in taiwan.	-1
the molecular phenotype of human cardiac myosin associated with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.  the aim of the study was to compare the functional and structural properties of the motor protein, myosin, and isolated myocyte contractility in heart muscle excised from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients by surgical myectomy with explanted failing heart and non-failing donor heart muscle. myosin was isolated and studied using an in vitro motility assay. the distribution of myosin light chain-1 isoforms was measured by two-dimensional electrophoresis. myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation was measured by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using pro-q diamond phosphoprotein stain. the fraction of actin filaments moving when powered by myectomy myosin was 21% less than with donor myosin (p = 0.006), whereas the sliding speed was not different (0.310 +/- 0.034 for myectomy myosin vs. 0.305 +/- 0.019 microm/s for donor myosin in six paired experiments). failing heart myosin showed 18% reduced motility. one myectomy myosin sample produced a consistently higher sliding speed than donor heart myosin and was identified with a disease-causing heavy chain mutation (v606m). in myectomy myosin, the level of atrial light chain-1 relative to ventricular light chain-1 was 20 +/- 5% compared with 11 +/- 5% in donor heart myosin and the level of myosin light chain-2 phosphorylation was decreased by 30-45%. isolated cardiomyocytes showed reduced contraction amplitude (1.61 +/- 0.25 vs. 3.58 +/- 0.40%) and reduced relaxation rates compared with donor myocytes (tt(50%) = 0.32 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.02 s). contractility in myectomy samples resembles the hypocontractile phenotype found in end-stage failing heart muscle irrespective of the primary stimulus, and this phenotype is not a direct effect of the hypertrophy-inducing mutation. the presence of a myosin heavy chain mutation causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be predicted from a simple functional assay.	-1
mechanistic and structural analysis of a family 31 alpha-glycosidase and its glycosyl-enzyme intermediate.  we have determined the first structure of a family 31 alpha-glycosidase, that of yici from escherichia coli, both free and trapped as a 5-fluoroxylopyranosyl-enzyme intermediate via reaction with 5-fluoro-alpha-d-xylopyranosyl fluoride. our 2.2-a resolution structure shows an intimately associated hexamer with structural elements from several monomers converging at each of the six active sites. our kinetic and mass spectrometry analyses verified several of the features observed in our structural data, including a covalent linkage from the carboxylate side chain of the identified nucleophile asp(416) to c-1 of the sugar ring. structure-based sequence comparison of yici with the mammalian alpha-glucosidases lysosomal alpha-glucosidase and sucrase-isomaltase predicts a high level of structural similarity and provides a foundation for understanding the various mutations of these enzymes that elicit human disease.	1
mutations in the gla gene and lysogb3: is it really anderson-fabry disease?  anderson-fabry disease (fd) is a rare, progressive, multisystem storage disorder caused by the partial or total deficit of the lysosomal enzyme ?-galactosidase a (?-gal a). it is an x-linked, lysosomal enzymopathy due to mutations in the galactosidase alpha gene (gla), encoding the ?-gal a. to date, more than 900 mutations in this gene have been described. in our laboratories, the study of genetic and enzymatic alterations related to fd was performed in about 17,000 subjects with a symptomatology referable to this disorder. the accumulation of globotriaosylsphingosine (lysogb3) was determined in blood of positives. exonic mutations in the gla gene were detected in 471 patients (207 probands and 264 relatives): 71.6% of mutations were associated with the classic phenotype, 19.8% were associated with the late-onset phenotype, and 8.6% of genetic variants were of unknown significance (gvus). the accumulation of lysogb3 was found in all male patients with a mutation responsible for classic or late-onset fd. lysogb3 levels were consistent with the type of mutations and the symptomatology of patients. ?-gal a activity in these patients is absent or dramatically reduced. in recent years, confusion about the pathogenicity of some mutations led to an association between non-causative mutations and fd. our study shows that the identification of fd patients is possible by associating clinical history, gla gene analysis, ?-gal a assay, and blood accumulation of lysogb3. in our experience, lysogb3 can be considered a reliable marker, which is very useful to confirm the diagnosis of fabry disease.	-1
identification of five novel mutations in the long isoform of the ush2a gene in chinese families with usher syndrome type ii.  usher syndrome type ii (ush2) is the most common form of usher syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by moderate to severe hearing loss, postpuberal onset of retinitis pigmentosa (rp), and normal vestibular function. mutations in the ush2a gene have been shown to be responsible for most cases of ush2. to further elucidate the role of ush2a in ush2, mutation screening was undertaken in three chinese families with ush2. three unrelated chinese families, consisting of six patients and 10 unaffected relatives, were examined clinically, and 100 normal chinese individuals served as controls. genomic dna was extracted from the venous blood of all participants. the coding region (exons 2-72), including the intron-exon boundary of ush2a, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products amplified from the three probands were analyzed using direct sequencing to screen sequence variants. whenever substitutions were identified in a patient, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, or single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was performed on all available family members and the control group. fundus examination revealed typical fundus features of rp, including narrowing of the vessels, bone-speckle pigmentation, and waxy optic discs. the erg wave amplitudes of three probands were undetectable. audiometric tests indicated moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment. vestibular function was normal. five novel mutations (one small insertion, one small deletion, one nonsense, one missense, and one splice site) were detected in three families after sequence analysis of ush2a. of the five mutations, four were located in exons 22-72, specific to the long isoform of ush2a. the mutations found in our study broaden the spectrum of ush2a mutations. our results further indicate that the long isoform of ush2a may harbor even more mutations of the ush2a gene.	-1
prevalence of mutations in a panel of breast cancer susceptibility genes in brca1/2-negative patients with early-onset breast cancer.  clinical testing for germ-line variation in multiple cancer susceptibility genes is available using massively parallel sequencing. limited information is available for pretest genetic counseling regarding the spectrum of mutations and variants of uncertain significance in defined patient populations. we performed massively parallel sequencing using targeted capture of 22 cancer susceptibility genes in 278 brca1/2-negative patients with early-onset breast cancer (diagnosed at younger than 40 years of age). thirty-one patients (11%) were found to have at least one deleterious or likely deleterious variant. seven patients (2.5% overall) were found to have deleterious or likely deleterious variants in genes for which clinical guidelines exist for management, namely tp53 (4), cdkn2a (1), msh2 (1), and mutyh (double heterozygote). twenty-four patients (8.6%) had deleterious or likely deleterious variants in a cancer susceptibility gene for which clinical guidelines are lacking, such as chek2 and atm. fifty-four patients (19%) had at least one variant of uncertain significance, and six patients were heterozygous for a variant in mutyh. these data demonstrate that massively parallel sequencing identifies reportable variants in known cancer susceptibility genes in more than 30% of patients with early-onset breast cancer. however, only few patients (2.5%) have definitively actionable mutations given current clinical management guidelines.genet med 17 8, 630-638.	-1
pten mutations in eight spanish families and one brazilian family with cowden syndrome.  cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis, characterized by the presence of multiple hamartomas in the skin, breast, thyroid, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, and an increased risk in developing breast and thyroid carcinomas. over 80 germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene pten, on chromosome 10q23, have been reported in more than 100 unrelated patients and families; however, questions regarding distribution of the mutations in populations from different geographic areas, and phenotypic expression are still unclear. in this study the results are reported of mutation analysis of pten in 13 families from spain and one family of brazilian origin with cowden syndrome. pten germline mutations were detected in nine of them (64%). five mutations were located in exon 5, one in exon 6, two in exon 7, and one in exon 8. four of the mutations were novel. in another case, an identical change had been previously reported as a somatic mutation in an endometrial carcinoma. in one family, the patient presented a de novo mutation, which was not detected in his parents. in five patients, the detection of the pten germline mutation confirmed their condition, even in the absence of sufficient criteria to make the clinical diagnosis of cowden syndrome.	1
successful immune tolerance induction to enzyme replacement therapy in crim-negative infantile pompe disease.  infantile pompe disease resulting from a deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) requires enzyme replacement therapy (ert) with recombinant human gaa (rhgaa). cross-reactive immunologic material negative (crim-negative) pompe patients develop high-titer antibody to the rhgaa and do poorly. we describe successful tolerance induction in crim-negative patients. two crim-negative patients with preexisting anti-gaa antibodies were treated therapeutically with rituximab, methotrexate, and gammaglobulins. two additional crim-negative patients were treated prophylactically with a short course of rituximab and methotrexate, in parallel with initiating rhgaa. in both patients treated therapeutically, anti-rhgaa was eliminated after 3 and 19 months. all four patients are immune tolerant to rhgaa, off immune therapy, showing b-cell recovery while continuing to receive ert at ages 36 and 56 months (therapeutic) and 18 and 35 months (prophylactic). all patients show clinical response to ert, in stark contrast to the rapid deterioration of their nontolerized crim-negative counterparts. the combination of rituximab with methotrexate  intravenous gammaglobulins (ivig) is an option for tolerance induction of crim-negative pompe to ert when instituted in the nave setting or following antibody development. it should be considered in other conditions in which antibody response to the therapeutic protein elicits robust antibody response that interferes with product efficacy.	-1
ptpn11 mutations in noonan syndrome type i: detection of recurrent mutations in exons 3 and 13.  we surveyed 16 subjects with the clinical diagnosis of noonan syndrome (ns1) from 12 families and their relevant family members for mutations in ptpn11/shp2 using direct dna sequencing. we found three different mutations among five families. two unrelated subjects shared the same de novo missense substitution in exon 13 (s502t); an additional two unrelated families had a mutation in exon 3 (y63c); and one subject had the amino acid substitution y62d, also in exon 3. none of the three mutations were present in ethnically matched controls. in the mature protein model, the exon 3 mutants and the exon 13 mutant amino acids cluster at the interface between the n' sh2 domain and the phosphatase catalytic domain. six of eight subjects with ptpn11/shp2 mutations had pulmonary valve stenosis while no mutations were identified in those subjects (n = 4) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. an additional four subjects with possible noonan syndrome were evaluated, but no mutations in ptpn11/shp2 were identified. these results confirm that mutations in ptpn11/shp2 underlie a common form of noonan syndrome, and that the disease exhibits both allelic and locus heterogeneity. the observation of recurrent mutations supports the hypothesis that a special class of gain-of-function mutations in shp2 give rise to noonan syndrome.	-1
newborn screening for fabry disease in the north-west of spain.  fabry disease is an x-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by the impairment of ?-galactosidase a. enzyme replacement therapy is available to treat patients, who often experience delayed diagnosis. a newborn screening for fabry disease was performed to study the prevalence of the pathology and to evaluate the possibility to implement the test in systematic screenings. we collected 14,600 dried blood spot samples (7575 males and 7025 females) and carried out a diagnostic study by fluorometric measurement of ?-galactosidase a enzymatic activity and gla gene sequencing. we detected one patient with a mutation in gla associated with classical fabry disease (m290i), ten subjects carrying genetic variants of uncertain diagnosis (s126g, r118c, a143t), and a girl with the non-characterized variant f18y, which was not previously described. additional 25 samples presented nucleotide substitutions described as polymorphisms (d313y, rs2071225, and rs2071397). the estimated prevalence for fabry disease in north-western spanish males is of 0.013%. these results confirm that the prevalence of fabry disease is underestimated and systematic screening is feasible; however, further characterization of variants of uncertain clinical significance is necessary to establish protocols of patients' management. what is known:  fabry disease is a rare disease of delayed diagnosis, whose prevalence is underestimated. however, early diagnosis is important for better efficiency of the current available treatment. what is new:  this newborn screening for fabry disease performed on spanish population reveals a prevalence of genetic alterations in gla of 0.1% in males (0.013% with classic fabry disease) and also characterizes these modifications in order to discriminate between pathogenic mutations and genetic variants of unknown significance.	1
germline multi-gene hereditary cancer panel testing in an unselected endometrial cancer cohort.  hereditary endometrial carcinoma is associated with germline mutations in lynch syndrome genes. the role of other cancer predisposition genes is unclear. we aimed to determine the prevalence of cancer predisposition gene mutations in an unselected endometrial carcinoma patient cohort. mutations in 25 genes were identified using a next-generation sequencing-based panel applied in 381 endometrial carcinoma patients who had undergone tumor testing to screen for lynch syndrome. thirty-five patients (9.2%) had a deleterious mutation: 22 (5.8%) in lynch syndrome genes (three mlh1, five msh2, two epcam-msh2, six msh6, and six pms2) and 13 (3.4%) in 10 non-lynch syndrome genes (four chek2, one each in apc, atm, bard1, brca1, brca2, brip1, nbn, pten, and rad51c). of 21 patients with deleterious mutations in lynch syndrome genes with tumor testing, 2 (9.5%) had tumor testing results suggestive of sporadic cancer. of 12 patients with deleterious mutations in msh6 and pms2, 10 were diagnosed at age >50 and 8 did not have a family history of lynch syndrome-associated cancers. patients with deleterious mutations in non-lynch syndrome genes were more likely to have serous tumor histology (23.1 vs 6.4%, p=0.02). the three patients with non-lynch syndrome deleterious mutations and serous histology had mutations in brca2, brip1, and rad51c. current clinical criteria fail to identify a portion of actionable mutations in lynch syndrome and other hereditary cancer syndromes. performance characteristics of tumor testing are sufficiently robust to implement universal tumor testing to identify patients with lynch syndrome. germline multi-gene panel testing is feasible and informative, leading to the identification of additional actionable mutations.	-1
a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for hearing loss using a microdroplet pcr-based approach and next generation sequencing.  implementing dna diagnostics in clinical practice for extremely heterogeneous diseases such as hearing loss is challenging, especially when attempting to reach high sensitivity and specificity in a cost-effective fashion. next generation sequencing has enabled the development of such a test, but the most commonly used genomic target enrichment methods such as hybridization-based capture suffer from restrictions. in this study, we have adopted a new flexible approach using microdroplet pcr-based technology for target enrichment, in combination with massive parallel sequencing to develop a dna diagnostic test for autosomal recessive hereditary hearing loss. this approach enabled us to identify the genetic basis of hearing loss in 9 of 24 patients, a success rate of 37.5%. our method also proved to have high sensitivity and specificity. currently, routine molecular genetic diagnostic testing for deafness is in most cases only performed for the gjb2 gene and a positive result is typically only obtained in 10-20% of deaf children. individuals with mutations in gjb2 had already been excluded in our selected set of 24 patients. therefore, we anticipate that our deafness test may lead to a genetic diagnosis in roughly 50% of unscreened autosomal recessive deafness cases. we propose that this diagnostic testing approach represents a significant improvement in clinical practice as a standard diagnostic tool for children with hearing loss.	-1
respiratory function in late-onset pompe disease patients receiving long-term enzyme replacement therapy for more than 48 months.  respiratory impairment is the most important prognostic factor in patients with adult-onset pompe disease. the effect of long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ert) on pulmonary function remains unclear.respiratory parameters (vital capacity (vcmax); forced expiratory volume (fev1); peak expiratory flow (pef); and blood gas analysis) were monitored every 6 months during a treatment period of 48-77 months of ert in six patients with genetically and biochemically confirmed adult-onset pompe disease. postural drop of vcmax from sitting to supine position, maximal inspiratory muscle pressure (pimax), mouth occlusion pressure after 100 ms (p0.1), and peak cough flow (pcf) were measured over a period of 12 months. mean change to baseline were +8.8 % points for ?vcmax, +6.2 % points for ?fev1, and +6.6 % points for ?pef after 48 months of ert. in one patient, a decrease of respiratory parameters with later stabilization was observed under ert until month 42, but noninvasive ventilation (niv) had to be initiated due to nocturnal desaturation. in the final 12 months period, progressive diaphragm weakness was detected in 3/6 patients (median change in vc% drop +8 %).ert seems to stabilize pulmonary function and may delay the requirement for ventilation in patients with late-onset pompe disease.	-1
roles for e-cadherin cell surface regulation in cancer.  the loss of e-cadherin expression in association with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) occurs frequently during tumor metastasis. however, metastases often retain e-cadherin expression, an emt is not required for metastasis, and metastases can arise from clusters of tumor cells. we demonstrate that the regulation of the adhesive activity of e-cadherin present at the cell surface by an inside-out signaling mechanism is important in cancer. first, we find that the metastasis of an e-cadherin-expressing mammary cell line from the mammary gland to the lung depends on reduced e-cadherin adhesive function. an activating monoclonal antibody to e-cadherin that induces a high adhesive state significantly reduced the number of cells metastasized to the lung without affecting the growth in size of the primary tumor in the mammary gland. second, we find that many cancer-associated germline missense mutations in the e-cadherin gene in patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer selectively affect the mechanism of inside-out cell surface regulation without inhibiting basic e-cadherin adhesion function. this suggests that genetic deficits in e-cadherin cell surface regulation contribute to cancer progression. analysis of these mutations also provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cadherin regulation at the cell surface.	1
frequent inactivation of pten/mmac1 in primary prostate cancer.  sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the western world, yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated. numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer. deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss. a new tumor suppressor gene, pten/mmac1, was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines. we screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases. we then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire pten/mmac1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity. the identification of the second mutational event in 10 (43%) tumors establishes pten/mmac1 as a main inactivation target of 10q loss in sporadic prostate cancer.	-1
pompe disease in austria: clinical, genetic and epidemiological aspects.  in this study, we performed a survey of infantile and late-onset pompe disease (iopd and lopd) in austria. paediatric and neuromuscular centres were contacted to provide a set of anonymized clinical and genetic data of patients with iopd and lopd. the number of patients receiving enzyme replacement therapy (ert) was obtained from the pharmaceutical company providing alglucosidase alfa. we found 25 patients in 24 families, 4 iopd and 21 lopd with a resulting prevalence of 1:350,914. the most frequent clinical manifestation in lopd was a lower limb-girdle phenotype combined with axial weakness. three patients were clinically pauci- or asymptomatic and were diagnosed because of persistent hyperckemia. diagnostic delay in lopd was 7.4  9.7 years. the most common mutation was c.-32-13t > g. all iopd and 17 symptomatic lopd patients are receiving ert. standardized follow-up was only available in six lopd patients for the 6-min walk test (6minwt) and in ten for the forced vital capacity (fvc). mean fvc did not decline (before ert; 63.6  39.7%; last evaluation during ert: 61.9  26.9%; p = 0.5) while there was a trend to decline in the mean distance covered by the 6minwt (before ert: 373.5  117.9 m; last evaluation during ert: 308.5  120.8 m; p = 0.077). the study shows a lower prevalence of pompe disease in austria than in other european countries and corroborates a limb-girdle phenotype with axial weakness as the most common clinical presentation, although asymptomatic hyperckemia may be the first indication of lopd.	-1
disease course in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa due to the ush2a gene.  to estimate the mean rates of ocular function loss in patients with autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa due to ush2a mutations. in 125 patients with ush2a mutations, longitudinal regression was used to estimate mean rates of change in snellen visual acuity, goldmann visual field area (v4e white test light), and 30-hz (cone) full-field electroretinogram amplitude. these rates were compared with those of previously studied cohorts with dominant retinitis pigmentosa due to rho mutations and with x-linked retinitis pigmentosa due to rpgr mutations. rates of change in patients with the cys759phe mutation, the ush2a mutation associated with nonsyndromic disease, were compared with rates of change in patients with the glu767fs mutation, the most common ush2a mutation associated with usher syndrome type ii (i.e., retinitis pigmentosa and hearing loss). mean annual exponential rates of decline for the ush2a patients were 2.6% for visual acuity, 7.0% for visual field area, and 13.2% for electroretinogram amplitude. the rate of acuity loss fell between the corresponding rates for the rho and rpgr patients, whereas the rates for field and erg amplitude loss were faster than those for the rho and rpgr patients. no significant differences were found for patients with the cys759phe mutation versus patients with the glu767fs mutation. on average, ush2a patients lose visual acuity faster than rho patients and slower than rpgr patients. ush2a patients lose visual field and cone electroretinogram amplitude faster than patients with rho or rpgr mutations. patients with a nonsyndromic ush2a mutation have the same retinal disease course as patients with syndromic ush2a disease.	-1
cancer susceptibility gene mutations in individuals with colorectal cancer.  purpose hereditary factors play an important role in colorectal cancer (crc) risk, yet the prevalence of germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations in patients with crc unselected for high-risk features (eg, early age at diagnosis, personal/family history of cancer or polyps, tumor microsatellite instability [msi], mismatch repair [mmr] deficiency) is unknown. patients and methods we recruited 1,058 participants who received crc care in a clinic-based setting without preselection for age at diagnosis, personal/family history, or msi/mmr results. all participants underwent germline testing for mutations in 25 genes associated with inherited cancer risk. each gene was categorized as high penetrance or moderate penetrance on the basis of published estimates of the lifetime cancer risks conferred by pathogenic germline mutations in that gene. results one hundred five (9.9%; 95% ci, 8.2% to 11.9%) of 1,058 participants carried one or more pathogenic mutations, including 33 (3.1%) with lynch syndrome (ls). twenty-eight (96.6%) of 29 available ls crcs demonstrated abnormal msi/mmr results. seventy-four (7.0%) of 1,058 participants carried non-ls gene mutations, including 23 (2.2%) with mutations in high-penetrance genes (five apc, three biallelic mutyh, 11 brca1/2, two palb2, one cdkn2a, and one tp53), 15 of whom lacked clinical histories suggestive of their underlying mutation. thirty-eight (3.6%) participants had moderate-penetrance crc risk gene mutations (19 monoallelic mutyh, 17 apc*i1307k, two chek2). neither proband age at crc diagnosis, family history of crc, nor personal history of other cancers significantly predicted the presence of pathogenic mutations in non-ls genes. conclusion germline cancer susceptibility gene mutations are carried by 9.9% of patients with crc. msi/mmr testing reliably identifies ls probands, although 7.0% of patients with crc carry non-ls mutations, including 1.0% with brca1/2 mutations.	-1
identification and functional characterisation of novel glucokinase mutations causing maturity-onset diabetes of the young in slovakia.  heterozygous glucokinase (gck) mutations cause a subtype of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (gck-mody). over 600 gck mutations have been reported of which ?65% are missense. in many cases co-segregation has not been established and despite the importance of functional studies in ascribing pathogenicity for missense variants these have only been performed for <10% of mutations. the aim of this study was to determine the minimum prevalence of gck-mody amongst diabetic subjects in slovakia by sequencing gck in 100 slovakian probands with a phenotype consistent with gck-mody and to explore the pathogenicity of identified variants through family and functional studies. twenty-two mutations were identified in 36 families (17 missense) of which 7 (i110n, v200a, n204d, g258r, f419s, c.580-2a>c, c.1113-1114delgc) were novel. parental dna was available for 22 probands (covering 14/22 mutations) and co-segregation established in all cases. bioinformatic analysis predicted all missense mutations to be damaging. nine (i110n, v200a, n204d, g223s, g258r, f419s, v244g, l315h, i436n) mutations were functionally evaluated. basic kinetic analysis explained pathogenicity for 7 mutants which showed reduced glucokinase activity with relative activity indices (rai) between 0.6 to <0.001 compared to wild-type gck (1.0). for the remaining 2 mutants additional molecular mechanisms were investigated. differences in glucokinase regulatory protein (gkrp) -mediated-inhibition of gck were observed for both l315h & i436n when compared to wild type (ic(50) 14.60.1 mm & 20.31.6 mm vs.13.30.1 mm respectively [p<0.03]). protein instability as assessed by thermal lability studies demonstrated that both l315h and i436n show marked thermal instability compared to wild-type gck (rai at 55c 8.80.8% & 3.10.4% vs. 42.53.9% respectively [p<0.001]). the minimum prevalence of gck-mody amongst slovakian patients with diabetes was 0.03%. in conclusion, we have identified 22 gck mutations in 36 slovakian probands and demonstrate that combining family, bioinformatic and functional studies can aid the interpretation of variants identified by molecular diagnostic screening.	-1
seven cases of pompe disease from greece.  we present seven cases of pompe disease (mckusick 232300; glycogen storage disease type ii; acid maltase deficiency) from greece. the onset of symptoms varied from early childhood to late adulthood, and the patients had quite variable duration of disease. all but one of them had muscle weakness and all had mildly to highly elevated serum creatine kinase. the diagnosis in all cases was confirmed by the finding of acid alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.3/20) deficiency in cultured skin fibroblasts. thirteen mutant alleles were identified and nine different pathogenic mutations were encountered. four were new: c.2071_2072insagccg leads to frameshift and total loss of function; c.1856g > a (p.ser619asn) leads to 90-95% loss of function; and the splice-site mutations c.1552-3c > g and c.2331+4a > g reduce the number of correct splicing events by more than 90%. the splice-site mutation c.-32-13t > g (ivs1-13t > g) was encountered four times and seems equally common among greek and other caucasians. the other mutations: c.925g > a (p.gly309arg), c.[307t > g; 271g > a] (p.cys103gly; asp91asn), c.271del and c.1655t > c (p.leu552pro) have been reported earlier. our study highlights the heterogeneity of pompe disease in greece and provides tools for diagnosis and carrier detection.	1
preliminary studies on the molecular basis of hyperphenylalaninemia in egypt.  mutation analysis at the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) locus was undertaken in 56 egyptian hyperphenylalaninemic patients. selected screening for 11 known mutations and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis of the entire coding sequence and exon/intron boundaries led to the identification of a new mutation (i224t), four previously described mutations, and several polymorphisms. overall, 18 mutant alleles could thus be characterized. in contrast to the high mutation detection rate typical of the dgge-based scanning approach, only 6 of 16 mutant alleles tested were identified. since bh4 deficiency could not be excluded in any of these patients, the latter results may be explained by the occurrence of mutations affecting the genes controlling the synthesis and recycling of tetrahydrobiopterin: the cofactor of pah. an alternative hypothesis is also discussed.	-1
dna sequence analysis and genotype-phenotype assessment in 71 patients with syndromic hearing loss or auditory neuropathy.  aetiological assessment of 71 probands whose clinical presentation suggested a genetic syndrome or auditory neuropathy. sanger sequencing was performed on dna isolated from peripheral blood or lymphoblastoid cell lines. genes were selected for sequencing based on each patient's clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis. observed dna sequence variations were assessed for pathogenicity by review of the scientific literature, and mutation and polymorphism databases, through the use of in silico tools including sorting intolerant from tolerant (sift) and polymorphism phenotyping (polyphen), and according to the recommendations of the american college of medical genetics and genomics for the interpretation of dna sequence variations. novel dna sequence variations were sought in controls. dna sequencing of the coding and near-coding regions of genes relevant to each patient's clinical presentation revealed 37 sequence variations of known or uncertain pathogenicity in 9 genes from 25 patients. 14 novel sequence variations were discovered. assessment of phenotypes revealed notable findings in 9 patients. dna sequencing in patients whose clinical presentation suggested a genetic syndrome or auditory neuropathy provided opportunities for aetiological assessment and more precise genetic counselling of patients and families. the failure to identify a genetic aetiology in many patients in this study highlights the extreme heterogeneity of genetic hearing loss, the incompleteness of current knowledge of aetiologies of hearing loss, and the limitations of conventional dna sequencing strategies that evaluate only coding and near-coding segments of genes.	-1
alkaptonuria and pompe disease in one patient: metabolic and molecular analysis.  pompe disease is characterised by deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase that results in abnormal glycogen deposition in the muscles. alkaptonuria is caused by a defect in the enzyme homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase with subsequent accumulation of homogentisic acid. we report the case of a 6-year-old boy diagnosed with pompe disease and alkaptonuria. urine organic acids and ?-glucosidase were measured. homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (hgo) and acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) genes were sequenced by sanger dna sequencing. the level of ?-glucosidase in white blood cells was markedly decreased (4 nm/mg) while the level of homogentisic acid was markedly increased (15 027 mmol/mol creatine). gaa sequencing detected two heterozygous gaa mutations (c.670c>t and c.1064t>c) while hgo sequencing revealed three polymorphisms in exons 4, 5 and 6, respectively. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of pompe disease and alkaptonuria occurring in the same individual.	-1
the influence of mutations in the slc26a4 gene on the temporal bone in a population with enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  to correlate genetic and audiometric findings with a detailed radiologic analysis of the temporal bone in patients with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) to ascertain the contribution of slc26a4 gene mutations to this phenotype. a retrospective review of patients with eva identified in a database of pediatric hearing-impaired patients. a tertiary care pediatric referral center. seventy-one children with eva and screening results for slc26a4 mutations. genetic screening results, audiometric thresholds, and radiographic temporal bone measurements. seventy-one children with eva were screened for slc26a4 mutations. mutations were found in 27% of children overall, while only 8% had biallelic mutations. the mean initial pure-tone average (pta) was 59 db; the mean final pta was 67 db. a bilateral eva was found in 48 (67%) of the children; a unilateral eva was found in 23 (33%). progressive hearing loss (in at least 1 ear) was seen in 29 (41%) of the patients. the strongest genotype-phenotype interaction was seen in children with a bilateral eva. among children with slc26a4 mutations, there was a significantly wider vestibular aqueduct at the midpoint and a wider vestibule width (p < .05) than in children without the mutation. among patients with a bilateral eva, children with any slc26a4 mutation were more likely to have a more severe final pta (64 db vs 32 db), larger midpoint measurement (2.1 vs 1.1 mm), and larger operculum measurement (3.0 vs 2.0 mm) than those without the mutation in their better-hearing ear (p < .05). in a population of pediatric patients with an eva and hearing loss, slc26a4 mutations are a contributor to the phenotype. our data suggest that other genetic factors also have important contributions to this phenotype. the presence of an abnormal slc26a4 allele, even in the heterozygous state, was associated with greater enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, abnormal development of the vestibule, and possibly a stable hearing outcome.	-1
brca1 and brca2 mutations in women of different ethnicities undergoing testing for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer.  in women at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer, the identification of a mutation in breast cancer gene 1 (brca1) and brca2 has important implications for screening and prevention counseling. uncertainty regarding the role of brca1 and brca2 testing in high-risk women from diverse ancestral backgrounds exists because of variability in prevalence estimates of deleterious (disease-associated) mutations in non-white populations. in this study, the authors examined the prevalence of brca1 and brca2 mutations in an ethnically diverse group of women who were referred for genetic testing. in this cross-sectional analysis, the prevalence of brca1 and brca2 mutations was assessed in a group of non-ashkenazi jewish women who underwent genetic testing. from 1996 to 2006, 46,276 women who met study criteria underwent dna full-sequence analysis of the brca1 and brca2 genes. deleterious mutations were identified in 12.5% of women, and recurrent deleterious mutations (prevalence >2%) were identified in all ancestral groups. women of non-european descent were younger (mean age, 45.9 years; standard deviation [sd], 11.6 years) than european women (mean age, 50 years; sd, 11.9 years; p < .001). women of african (15.6%; odds ratio [or], 1.3 [95% confidence interval (95% ci), 1.1-1.5]) and latin american (14.8%; or, 1.2 [95% ci, 1.1-1.4]) ancestries had a significantly higher prevalence of deleterious brca1 and brca2 mutations compared with women of western european ancestry (12.1%), primarily because of an increased prevalence of brca1 mutations in those 2 groups. non-european ethnicity was associated strongly with having a variant of uncertain significance; however, reclassification decreased variant reporting (from 12.8%-->5.9%), and women of african ancestry experienced the largest decline (58%). mutation prevalence was found to be high among women who were referred for clinical brca1 and brca2 testing, and the risk was similar across diverse ethnicities. brca1 and brca2 testing is integral to cancer risk assessment in all high-risk women.	-1
the identification of pompe disease mutations in archival tissues and development of a rapid molecular-based test.  pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type ii) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease that is caused by acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. early enzyme replacement therapy can benefit infants with the disease but the diagnosis is complicated by the rarity of the disease and the heterogeneity of the clinical manifestations. in this study, dna extracted from archival postmortem formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues was used to identify pompe disease mutations in oman and develop a rapid molecular-based test. intronic primers were designed to amplify short fragments (193-454 base pairs [bp]) from coding exons (2-20) and screen for mutations using direct sequencing (ds). two mutations known to cause severe disease were identified in two samples. one was a coding mutation, c.2560c>t (p.arg854x), and the second was found at a splice acceptor site, c.1327-2a>g. polymerase chain reaction- and restriction fragment length polymorphism-based tests were designed for the rapid genotyping of the identified mutations. these tests can facilitate prenatal diagnosis and help in identifying carriers in families with the identified mutations.	-1
how do mybpc3 mutations cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?  it is well established that mybpc3 mutations are the most common cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, accounting for about half of identified mutations. however, when compared with mutations in other myofibrillar proteins that cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mybpc3 mutations seem to be the odd one out. the most striking characteristic of hcm mutations in mybpc3 is that many are within introns and are predicted to cause aberrant splicing leading to a frameshift and a premature chain termination, yet the truncated peptides have never been identified in human heart tissue carrying these mutations. instead of expression of a poison peptide we consistently observe haploinsufficiency of mybp-c in mybpc3 mutant human heart muscle. in this review we investigate the mechanism for mybp-c haploinsufficiency and consider how this haploinsufficiency could cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.	1
identification of two different mutations in the pds gene in an inbred family with pendred syndrome.  recently the gene responsible for pendred syndrome (pds) was isolated and several mutations in the pds gene have been identified in pendred patients. here we report the occurrence of two different pds mutations in an extended inbred turkish family. the majority of patients in this family are homozygous for a splice site mutation (1143-2a-->g) affecting the 3' splice site consensus sequence of intron 7. however, two affected sibs with non-consanguineous parents are compound heterozygotes for the splice site mutation and a missense mutation (1558t-->g), substituting an evolutionarily conserved amino acid. the latter mutation has been found previously in two pendred families originating from the netherlands, indicating that the 1558t-->g mutation may be a common mutation.	-1

mutations in the genes encoding the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha and 4 alpha in maturity-onset diabetes of the young and hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a monogenic disorder characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance of young-onset (typically <25 years), noninsulin-dependent diabetes due to defective insulin secretion. mody is both clinically and genetically heterogeneous with mutations in at least 10 genes. mutations in the hnf1a gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 alpha are the most common cause of mody in most adult populations studied. the number of different pathogenic hnf1a mutations totals 414 in 1,247 families. mutations in the hnf4a gene encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha are a rarer cause of mody with 103 different mutations reported in 173 families to date. sensitivity to treatment with sulfonylurea tablets is a feature of both hnf1a and hnf4a mutations. the hnf4a mody phenotype has been expanded by the reports of macrosomia in ?50% of babies, and more rarely, neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. the identification of an hnf1a or hnf4a gene mutation has important implications for clinical management in diabetes and pregnancy, but mody is significantly underdiagnosed. current research is focused on identifying biomarkers and developing probability models to identify those patients most likely to have mody, until next generation sequencing technology enables cost-effective gene analysis for all patients with young onset diabetes.	-1
beta-myosin heavy chain gene mutations and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in austrian children.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs in two variants, either as an autosomal dominant familial disorder or as a sporadic disease without familial involvement. different genes coding sarcomeric proteins of the heart have been identified as causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. missense mutations in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene are found in 30% of all cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. we screened the beta-myosin heavy chain gene of children of nine austrian families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (referred to as group a) and of seven children with sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (referred to as group b). we were able to find two previously described (v606m, r453c) and two unknown missense mutations (v406m, r663h) in group a. additionally, in two children of group b we could identify one already known missense mutation, r249q as well as one previously unknown missense mutation, m877k. the genetically affected children of group a developed no or only mild clinical symptoms, whereas the children of group b with genetically confirmed sporadic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy showed manifest left ventricular hypertrophy and clinical symptoms including chest pain and dyspnoea. clinical symptoms among the adults of group a, suffering from familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, varied significantly. we therefore believe v406m to be a more malignant missense mutation, probably linked with sudden death in the affected family, than r663h, which seems to be more benign causing late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mild clinical symptoms in the affected family members.	-1
e-cadherin mutation-based genetic counseling and hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma.  the e-cadherin mutation has been identified in a subset of families with multiple cases of diffuse gastric carcinoma. however, the true penetrance of this mutation and its association with other carcinomas in such families remains elusive. we aim to show the importance of dna-based genetic counseling in hereditary diffuse gastric carcinoma. the proband was self-referred after three of his siblings died of diffuse gastric carcinoma. medical and pathology records confirmed diagnoses. the family was educated about diffuse gastric carcinoma. analysis for the 70g-->t mutation was performed by sequencing genomic dna from lymphocyte pellets. dna results and genetic counseling were provided individually to those tested. twenty-four family members were tested for the e-cadherin mutation. nine were found to be positive and 15 were negative. three who tested positive and were affected are now deceased. none of the 19 patients counseled wanted results sent to their physicians once they recognized the potential for insurance discrimination. none had undergone endoscopic ultrasound. three who were positive for the e-cadherin mutation expressed strong interest in prophylactic gastrectomy. the e-cadherin mutation strongly predicts susceptibility to diffuse gastric carcinoma. emotional stress in at-risk patients, the limited knowledge of the mutation's penetrance, and limitations of available screening mandate patient-centered genetic counseling.	-1
comparison of sscp and dhplc for the detection of ldlr mutations in a new zealand cohort.  familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) is a common inherited disorder, associated with premature vascular disease. fh may be caused by many different mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene, about 700 mutations have been described, most of which occur rarely and often only in single families. although particular mutations are prevalent in certain ethnic groups, countries with heterogeneous population bases (such as nz) may carry a wide variety of mutations; making a gene screening approach the appropriate first step for a mutation detection programme. we have compared sscp with dhplc to assess their effectiveness as methods for ldlr mutation detection. although five novel ldlr mutations were detected by sscp in patients with fh, dhplc was more sensitive, with eight novel mutations detected. six of these mutations (t392m, r419g, y421n, 1206-1207delct, 1872delc, and 1943delc) were clustered in exons 9 and 13 of the egf precursor homology domain, one (679-680delac) in the ligand binding domain (exon 4) and the eighth (p774h) in the membrane-spanning domain (exon 16). twenty five mutations were identified in 35 patients in total. of these, we were able to detect only 64% of mutations by sscp even though all variants were detected by dhplc. all patients are heterozygous for the mutations, which is consistent with the clinical phenotypes.	-1
germline pten promoter mutations and deletions in cowden/bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome result in aberrant pten protein and dysregulation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/akt pathway.  germline intragenic mutations in pten are associated with 80% of patients with cowden syndrome (cs) and 60% of patients with bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brrs). the underlying genetic causes remain to be determined in a considerable proportion of classic cs and brrs without a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-detectable pten mutation. we hypothesized that gross gene deletions and mutations in the pten promoter might alternatively account for a subset of apparently mutation-negative patients with cs and brrs. using real time and multiplex pcr techniques, we identified three germline hemizygous pten deletions in 122 apparently mutation-negative patients with classic cs (n=95) or brrs (n=27). fine mapping suggested that one deletion encompassed the whole gene and the other two included exon 1 and encompassed exons 1-5 of pten, respectively. two patients with the deletion were diagnosed with brrs, and one patient with the deletion was diagnosed with brrs/cs overlap (features of both). thus 3 (11%) of 27 patients with brrs or brrs/cs-overlap had pten deletions. analysis of the pten promoter revealed nine cases (7.4%) harboring heterozygous germline mutations. all nine had classic cs, representing almost 10% of all subjects with cs. eight had breast cancers and/or benign breast tumors but, otherwise, oligo-organ involvement. pten protein analysis, from one deletion-positive and five pten-promoter-mutation-positive samples, revealed a 50% reduction in protein and multiple bands of immunoreactive protein, respectively. in contrast, control samples showed only the expected band. further, an elevated level of phosphorylated akt was detected in the five promoter-mutation-positive samples, compared with controls, indicating an absence of or marked reduction in functional pten. these data suggest that patients with brrs and cs without pcr-detected intragenic pten mutations be offered clinical deletion analysis and promoter-mutation analysis, respectively.	-1
a european multicenter study of phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: classification of 105 mutations and a general system for genotype-based prediction of metabolic phenotype.  phenylketonuria (pku) and mild hyperphenylalaninemia (mhp) are allelic disorders caused by mutations in the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah). previous studies have suggested that the highly variable metabolic phenotypes of pah deficiency correlate with pah genotypes. we identified both causative mutations in 686 patients from seven european centers. on the basis of the phenotypic characteristics of 297 functionally hemizygous patients, 105 of the mutations were assigned to one of four arbitrary phenotype categories. we proposed and tested a simple model for correlation between genotype and phenotypic outcome. the observed phenotype matched the predicted phenotype in 79% of the cases, and in only 5 of 184 patients was the observed phenotype more than one category away from that expected. among the seven contributing centers, the proportion of patients for whom the observed phenotype did not match the predicted phenotype was 4%-23% (p<.0001), suggesting that differences in methods used for mutation detection or phenotype classification may account for a considerable proportion of genotype-phenotype inconsistencies. our data indicate that the pah-mutation genotype is the main determinant of metabolic phenotype in most patients with pah deficiency. in the present study, the classification of 105 pah mutations may allow the prediction of the biochemical phenotype in >10,000 genotypes, which may be useful for the management of hyperphenylalaninemia in newborns.	-1
germline inactivation of pten and dysregulation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/akt pathway cause human lhermitte-duclos disease in adults.  lhermitte-duclos disease (ldd), or dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum, is an unusual hamartomatous overgrowth disorder. ldd can be familial or, more commonly, sporadic. it has been only recently recognized that ldd may be associated with cowden syndrome (cs). over 80% of patients with cs carry germline mutations in pten. it remains unclear whether all cases of ldd, even without features of cs, are caused by germline pten mutation and whether somatic pten mutation occurs in sporadic ldd. we obtained paraffin-embedded ldd lesions from 18 unselected, unrelated patients and performed mutational analysis of pten. overall, 15 (83%) of 18 samples were found to carry a pten mutation. all individuals with mutations were adult-onset patients, but the three without mutations were diagnosed at the ages of 1, 3, and 11 years. germline dna was available from six adult-onset cases, and all had germline pten mutations. of these six, two had cs features, one did not have cs features, and three were of unknown cs status. immunohistochemistry revealed that 75% of the ldd samples had complete or partial loss of pten expression accompanied by elevated phosphorylated akt, specifically in the dysplastic gangliocytoma cells. these data suggest that the loss of pten function is sufficient to cause ldd. the high frequency and spectrum of germline pten mutations in patients ascertaining by ldd alone confirm that ldd is an important defining feature of cs. individuals with ldd, even without apparent cs features, should be counseled as in cs.	-1
the pharmacological chaperone at2220 increases the specific activity and lysosomal delivery of mutant acid alpha-glucosidase, and promotes glycogen reduction in a transgenic mouse model of pompe disease.  pompe disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that results from a deficiency in acid ?-glucosidase (gaa) activity due to mutations in the gaa gene. pompe disease is characterized by accumulation of lysosomal glycogen primarily in heart and skeletal muscles, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. we have shown previously that the small molecule pharmacological chaperone at2220 (1-deoxynojirimycin hydrochloride, duvoglustat hydrochloride) binds and stabilizes wild-type as well as multiple mutant forms of gaa, and can lead to higher cellular levels of gaa. in this study, we examined the effect of at2220 on mutant gaa, in vitro and in vivo, with a primary focus on the endoplasmic reticulum (er)-retained p545l mutant form of human gaa (p545l gaa). at2220 increased the specific activity of p545l gaa toward both natural (glycogen) and artificial substrates in vitro. incubation with at2220 also increased the er export, lysosomal delivery, proteolytic processing, and stability of p545l gaa. in a new transgenic mouse model of pompe disease that expresses human p545l on a gaa knockout background (tg/ko) and is characterized by reduced gaa activity and elevated glycogen levels in disease-relevant tissues, daily oral administration of at2220 for 4 weeks resulted in significant and dose-dependent increases in mature lysosomal gaa isoforms and gaa activity in heart and skeletal muscles. importantly, oral administration of at2220 also resulted in significant glycogen reduction in disease-relevant tissues. compared to daily administration, less-frequent at2220 administration, including repeated cycles of 4 or 5 days with at2220 followed by 3 or 2 days without drug, respectively, resulted in even greater glycogen reductions. collectively, these data indicate that at2220 increases the specific activity, trafficking, and lysosomal stability of p545l gaa, leads to increased levels of mature gaa in lysosomes, and promotes glycogen reduction in situ. as such, at2220 may warrant further evaluation as a treatment for pompe disease.	1
a chaperone enhances blood ?-glucosidase activity in pompe disease patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy.  enzyme replacement therapy is currently the only approved treatment for pompe disease, due to acid ?-glucosidase deficiency. clinical efficacy of this approach is variable, and more effective therapies are needed. we showed in preclinical studies that chaperones stabilize the recombinant enzyme used for enzyme replacement therapy. here, we evaluated the effects of a combination of enzyme therapy and a chaperone on ?-glucosidase activity in pompe disease patients. ?-glucosidase activity was analyzed by tandem-mass spectrometry in dried blood spots from patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy, either alone or in combination with the chaperone n-butyldeoxynojirimycin given at the time of the enzyme infusion. thirteen patients with different presentations (3 infantile-onset, 10 late-onset) were enrolled. in 11 patients, the combination treatment resulted in ?-glucosidase activities greater than 1.85-fold the activities with enzyme replacement therapy alone. in the whole patient population, ?-glucosidase activity was significantly increased at 12 hours (2.19-fold, p = 0.002), 24 hours (6.07-fold, p = 0.001), and 36 hours (3.95-fold, p = 0.003). the areas under the curve were also significantly increased (6.78-fold, p = 0.002). these results suggest improved stability of recombinant ?-glucosidase in blood in the presence of the chaperone.	-1
molecular basis of familial hypercholesterolemia in brazil: identification of seven novel ldlr gene mutations.  low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) gene mutations cause familial hypercholesterol-emia (fh), one of the most common single gene disorders. the spectrum of ldlr mutations in brazil is not known. the aim of this study was the characterization of ldlr mutations in 35 unrelated brazilian patients with heterozygous fh. the promoter region, the 18 exons and the flanking intron sequences of the ldlr gene were screened by pcr-sscp analysis and by dna sequencing. in addition, we have screened the apolipoprotein b gene (apob) for known mutations (r3500q and r3531c) that cause familial defective apo b-100 (fdb) by pcr-rflp procedure. we found two nonsense (e92x and c371x) and six missense ldlr mutations (r236w, g322s, g352d, a370t, c675w and c677y), that were previously described in fh patients from other populations. we also found five novel missense [g(-20)r, t476p, v503g, d580h and s652r] and two novel frame shift ldlr mutations (fsr757 and fss828). four patients were found to carry two different mutations in the ldlr gene: g352d and a370t (one patient), s652r and c675w (one patient) and t476p and v503g (two patients). apob mutations were not found. these findings demonstrate that there is a broad spectrum of mutations in the ldlr gene in fh individuals from brazil.	-1

mutations of the beta myosin heavy chain gene in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: critical functional sites determine prognosis.  to assess patients with different types of mutations of the beta myosin heavy chain (beta mhc) gene causing hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) and to determine the prognosis of patients according to the affected functional domain of beta mhc. cohort study of subjects referred to an hcm clinic at an academic hospital. 70 probands from the hcm clinic were screened for mutations of the beta mhc gene and 148 family members of the genotype positive probands were further assessed. the control group for the genetic studies consisted of 106 healthy subjects. direct dna sequencing was used to screen 70 probands for mutations of the beta mhc gene. family members underwent genotypic and detailed clinical, ecg, and echocardiographic assessments. the survival of genotype positive subjects was evaluated according to the type of functional domain affected by the missense mutation and according to phenotypic characteristics. a mutation of the beta mhc gene was detected in 15 of 70 probands (21%). of 148 family members studied in these 15 families, 74 were identified with a beta mhc defect. eleven mutations were detected, including four novel mutations: ala196thr, pro211leu, val404leu, and arg870cys. median survival was 66 years (95% confidence interval (ci) 64 to 77 years) in all affected subjects. there was a significant difference in survival between subjects according to the affected functional domain (p = 0.02). significant independent predictors of decreased survival were the non-conservative (that is, associated with a change in the amino acid charge) missense mutations that affected the actin binding site (hazard ratio 4.4, 95% ci 1.6 to 11.8; p = 0.003) and those that affected the rod portion of beta mhc (hazard ratio 4.8, 95% ci 1.2 to 19.4; p = 0.03). no phenotypic characteristics were associated with decreased survival or cardiovascular morbidity. the type of beta mhc functional domain affected by the missense mutation is predictive of overall prognosis in hcm.	-1
characteristics of maturity onset diabetes of the young in a large diabetes center.  maturity onset diabetes of the young (mody) is a monogenic form of diabetes caused by a mutation in a single gene, often not requiring insulin. the aim of this study was to estimate the frequency and clinical characteristics of mody at the barbara davis center. a total of 97 subjects with diabetes onset before age 25, a random c-peptide ?0.1 ng/ml, and negative for all diabetes autoantibodies (gada, ia-2, znt8, and iaa) were enrolled, after excluding 21 subjects with secondary diabetes or refusal to participate. genetic testing for mody 1-5 was performed through athena diagnostics, and all variants of unknown significance were further analyzed at exeter, uk. a total of 22 subjects [20 (21%) when excluding two siblings] were found to have a mutation in hepatocyte nuclear factor 4a (n = 4), glucokinase (n = 8), or hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a (n = 10). of these 22 subjects, 13 had mutations known to be pathogenic and 9 (41%) had novel mutations, predicted to be pathogenic. only 1 of the 22 subjects had been given the appropriate mody diagnosis prior to testing. compared with mody-negative subjects, the mody-positive subjects had lower hemoglobin a1c level and no diabetic ketoacidosis at onset; however, these characteristics are not specific for mody. in summary, this study found a high frequency of mody mutations with the majority of subjects clinically misdiagnosed. clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for mody in youth with antibody-negative diabetes.	-1

melanocortin-4 receptor gene variation is associated with eating behavior in chilean adults.  to evaluate the association between allelic variants of melanocortin receptors -3 and -4 (mc3r and mc4r, respectively) and leptin receptor (lepr) genes with body mass index (bmi) and eating behavior. we selected 344 chilean adults (57.8% women; age 39.1  6.6 years) with a wide variation in bmi (30.3  6.3 kg/m). the three-factor eating questionnaire-r18 that measures uncontrolled eating (ue), emotional eating (ee) and cognitive restraint scores was adapted, validated and assessed for association with bmi. genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques and taqman assays. higher ee scores were found in obese vs. non-obese in both men (p = 0.01) and women (p < 0.001). ue scores were significantly associated with bmi only in women (p = 0.002). no significant differences in eating behavior scores or bmi were found by lepr (rs1137101, rs8179183 and rs1137100 polymorphisms) or mc3r (rs3746619 and rs3827103). carriers of the c allele for mc4r rs17782313 showed significantly higher scores of ue compared to non-carriers (2.3  0.8 vs. 2.0  0.7; p = 0.02). additionally, we also report a monogenic case of obesity carrying the pathogenic mutation 449c>t (thr150ile) in mc4r gene with no apparent alterations in eating behavior scores. ue scores were higher in c-allele carriers of mc4r-rs17782313 compared to non-carriers.	-1
lack of significant association between mutations of kcnj10 or foxi1 and slc26a4 mutations in pendred syndrome/enlarged vestibular aqueducts.  pendred syndrome is a common autosomal recessive disorder causing deafness. features include sensorineural hearing impairment, goitre, enlarged vestibular aqueducts (eva) and occasionally mondini dysplasia. hearing impairment and eva may occur in the absence of goitre or thyroid dyshormonogensis in a condition known as non-syndromic eva. a significant number of patients with pendred syndrome and non-syndromic eva show only one mutation in slc26a4. two genes, kcnj10, encoding an inwardly rectifying potassium channel and foxi1, a transcriptional factor gene, are thought to play a role in the disease phenotypes. using polymerase chain reaction and sanger sequencing, sixty-eight patients with monoallelic mutations of slc26a4 were tested for mutations in kcnj10 and foxi1. two variants were observed in the kcnj10 gene, p.arg271cys in three patients and p.arg18gln in one patient; only one variant, p.arg123trp was observed in the foxi1 gene in a single patient. both p.arg271cys and p.arg18gln are likely to be polymorphisms as judged by their frequency in the general population. therefore we found no evidence for a significant association between mutations of kcnj10 and foxi1 with slc26a4. it was also observed that the variant, p.arg271cys in kcnj10, previously thought to have a protective effect against seizure susceptibility, was found in a patient with pendred syndrome with co-existing epilepsy.	-1
long-term weight-loss in gastric bypass patients carrying melanocortin 4 receptor variants.  the melanocortin 4 receptor (mc4r) critically regulates feeding and satiety. rare variants in mc4r are predominantly found in obese individuals. though some rare variants in mc4r discovered in patients have defects in localization, ligand binding and signaling to camp, many have no recognized defects. in our cohort of 1433 obese subjects that underwent roux-en-y gastric bypass (rygb) surgery, we found fifteen variants of mc4r. we matched rare variant carriers to patients with the mc4r reference alleles for gender, age, starting bmi and t2d to determine the variant effect on weight-loss post-rygb. in vitro, we determined expression of mutant receptors by elisa and western blot, and camp production by microscopy. while carrying a rare mc4r allele is associated with obesity, carriers of rare variants exhibited comparable weight-loss after rygb to non-carriers. however, subjects carrying three of these variants, v95i, i137t or l250q, lost less weight after surgery. in vitro, the r305q mutation caused a defect in cell surface expression while only the i137t and c326r mutations showed impaired camp signaling. despite these apparent differences, there was no correlation between in vitro signaling and pre- or post-surgery clinical phenotype. these data suggest that subtle differences in receptor signaling conferred by rare mc4r variants combined with additional factors predispose carriers to obesity. in the absence of complete mc4r deficiency, these differences can be overcome by the powerful weight-reducing effects of bariatric surgery. in a complex disorder such as obesity, genetic variants that cause subtle defects that have cumulative effects can be overcome after appropriate clinical intervention.	1
bag3-related myofibrillar myopathy in a chinese family.  in contrast to the usual slow disease progression in myofibrillar myopathies, patients with bag3opathy often have a rapidly progressive and more severe phenotype with a worse prognosis. we describe a chinese patient, born to non-consanguineous parents, who first presented at age 6 with clumsy walking and difficult climbing staircase. with a history of restrictive lung disease previously diagnosed as asthma, she progressed rapidly with proximal myopathy, rigid spine and bilateral tightening of the achilles tendons requiring surgical elongation. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology was shown by echocardiogram. moreover, prolonged qt interval was also noted in the patient. family history was unremarkable yet her father was incidentally found to have prolonged qt interval. mutation analysis with genomic dna of the proband showed heterozygous de novo known mutation c.626c>t (p.pro209leu) and a germline variation c.772c>t (p.arg258trp) in bag3. her father was found to be a carrier of c.772c>t. muscle biopsy findings were suggestive of myofibrillar myopathy on light microscopy and ultrastructural studies. to our knowledge, this is the first chinese case of bag3opathy so far reported.	-1
"membrane association of the pten tumor suppressor: molecular details of the protein-membrane complex from spr binding studies and neutron reflection.  the structure and function of the pten phosphatase is investigated by studying its membrane affinity and localization on in-plane fluid, thermally disordered synthetic membrane models. the membrane association of the protein depends strongly on membrane composition, where phosphatidylserine (ps) and phosphatidylinositol diphosphate (pi(4,5)p(2)) act pronouncedly synergistic in pulling the enzyme to the membrane surface. the equilibrium dissociation constants for the binding of wild type (wt) pten to ps and pi(4,5)p(2) were determined to be k(d)?12 m and 0.4 m, respectively, and k(d)?50 nm if both lipids are present. membrane affinities depend critically on membrane fluidity, which suggests multiple binding sites on the protein for pi(4,5)p(2). the pten mutations c124s and h93r show binding affinities that deviate strongly from those measured for the wt protein. both mutants bind ps more strongly than wt pten. while c124s pten has at least the same affinity to pi(4,5)p(2) and an increased apparent affinity to pi(3,4,5)p(3), due to its lack of catalytic activity, h93r pten shows a decreased affinity to pi(4,5)p(2) and no synergy in its binding with ps and pi(4,5)p(2). neutron reflection measurements show that the pten phosphatase ""scoots"" along the membrane surface (penetration <5 ) but binds the membrane tightly with its two major domains, the c2 and phosphatase domains, as suggested by the crystal structure. the regulatory c-terminal tail is most likely displaced from the membrane and organized on the far side of the protein, ?60  away from the bilayer surface, in a rather compact structure. the combination of binding studies and neutron reflection allows us to distinguish between pten mutant proteins and ultimately may identify the structural features required for membrane binding and activation of pten."	1
comprehensive sequence analysis of nine usher syndrome genes in the uk national collaborative usher study.  usher syndrome (ush) is an autosomal recessive disorder comprising retinitis pigmentosa, hearing loss and, in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. it is clinically and genetically heterogeneous with three distinctive clinical types (i-iii) and nine usher genes identified. this study is a comprehensive clinical and genetic analysis of 172 usher patients and evaluates the contribution of digenic inheritance. the genes myo7a, ush1c, cdh23, pcdh15, ush1g, ush2a, gpr98, whrn, clrn1 and the candidate gene slc4a7 were sequenced in 172 uk usher patients, regardless of clinical type. no subject had definite mutations (nonsense, frameshift or consensus splice site mutations) in two different ush genes. novel missense variants were classified uv1-4 (unclassified variant): uv4 is 'probably pathogenic', based on control frequency <0.23%, identification in trans to a pathogenic/probably pathogenic mutation and segregation with ush in only one family; and uv3 ('likely pathogenic') as above, but no information on phase. overall 79% of identified pathogenic/uv4/uv3 variants were truncating and 21% were missense changes. myo7a accounted for 53.2%, and ush1c for 14.9% of ush1 families (ush1c:c.496+1g>a being the most common ush1 mutation in the cohort). ush2a was responsible for 79.3% of ush2 families and gpr98 for only 6.6%. no mutations were found in ush1g, whrn or slc4a7. one or two pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were identified in 86% of cases. no convincing cases of digenic inheritance were found. it is concluded that digenic inheritance does not make a significant contribution to usher syndrome; the observation of multiple variants in different genes is likely to reflect polymorphic variation, rather than digenic effects.	-1
glycogen storage disease type ii: identification of a dinucleotide deletion and a common missense mutation in the lysosomal alpha-glucosidase gene.  in nine dutch patients with the infantile form of glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii), who were compound heterozygous for either 525delt or exon18del (1), sequence analysis was performed to search for the mutations in the second lysosomal alpha-glucosidase allele. one patient had a novel tg deletion at cdna position 379 + 380. surprisingly five of the nine patients had the same two base pair changes: a921 --> t and g925 --> a. the first change is a well-known polymorphism but the second one is a novel mutation and results in the substitution of gly309 by arg. by screening 43 other gsdii patients the same mutation was found in two other cases, one from the netherlands and one from france. to verify its deleterious effect, the mutation was introduced in the wild type lysosomal alpha-glucosidase cdna and expressed in cos cells.	1
genetic screening of the lpl gene in hypertriglyceridaemic patients.  serum triglyceride (tg) level is an important independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, with the lipoprotein lipase (lpl) enzyme playing the major role in regulating the catabolism of tg rich lipoproteins. the complete sequence analysis of the lpl gene was carried out on 19 individuals with extreme hypertriglyceridaemia (htg; tg>14 mmol/l) with a total of 42 sequence variants being identified, a number of which are novel to this study. a total of eight patients were shown to have functional variants (p.d36n, p.r197h, p.n318s, p.v340i) that alter amino acids at 11 of the 16 lpl alleles. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa) analysis showed no exonic deletion or duplications in this population. further analysis of the p.n318s (also called n291s) variant identified in the sequencing screen, in larger case and control populations, identified this mutation to be strongly associated with htg. this study has produced a more comprehensive snp map of lpl and its surrounding area and identified p.n318s as a major predisposing factor to htg in the northern irish population.	-1
insights into the pathogenicity of rare missense gck variants from the identification and functional characterization of compound heterozygous and double mutations inherited in cis.  to demonstrate the importance of using a combined genetic and functional approach to correctly interpret a genetic test for monogenic diabetes. we identified three probands with a phenotype consistent with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) subtype gck-mody, in whom two potential pathogenic mutations were identified: [r43h/g68d], [e248 k/i225m], or [g261r/d217n]. allele-specific pcr and cosegregation were used to determine phase. single and double mutations were kinetically characterized. the mutations occurred in cis (double mutants) in two probands and in trans in one proband. functional studies of all double mutants revealed inactivating kinetics. the previously reported gck-mody mutations r43h and g68d were inherited from an affected father and unaffected mother, respectively. both our functional and genetic studies support r43h as the cause of gck-mody and g68d as a neutral rare variant. these data highlight the need for family/functional studies, even for previously reported pathogenic mutations.	-1
pten mutation spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations in bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome suggest a single entity with cowden syndrome.  germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene pten have been implicated in two hamartoma syndromes that exhibit some clinical overlap, cowden syndrome (cs) and bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome (brr). pten maps to 10q23 and encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, a substrate of which is phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, a phospholipid in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. cs is characterized by multiple hamartomas and an increased risk of benign and malignant disease of the breast, thyroid and central nervous system, whilst the presence of cancer has not been formally documented in brr. the partial clinical overlap in these two syndromes is exemplified by the hallmark features of brr: macrocephaly and multiple lipomas, the latter of which occur in a minority of individuals with cs. additional features observed in brr, which may also occur in a minority of cs patients, include hashimoto's thyroiditis, vascular malformations and mental retardation. pigmented macules of the glans penis, delayed motor development and neonatal or infant onset are noted only in brr. in this study, constitutive dna samples from 43 brr individuals comprising 16 sporadic and 27 familial cases, 11 of which were families with both cs and brr, were screened for pten mutations. mutations were identified in 26 of 43 (60%) brr cases. genotype-phenotype analyses within the brr group suggested a number of correlations, including the association of pten mutation and cancer or breast fibroadenoma in any given cs, brr or brr/cs overlap family ( p = 0.014), and, in particular, truncating mutations were associated with the presence of cancer and breast fibroadenoma in a given family ( p = 0.024). additionally, the presence of lipomas was correlated with the presence of pten mutation in brr patients ( p = 0.028). in contrast to a prior report, no significant difference in mutation status was found in familial versus sporadic cases of brr ( p = 0.113). comparisons between brr and a previously studied group of 37 cs families suggested an increased likelihood of identifying a germline pten mutation in families with either cs alone or both cs and brr when compared with brr alone ( p = 0.002). among cs, brr and brr/cs overlap families that are pten mutation positive, the mutation spectra appear similar. thus, pten mutation-positive cs and brr may be different presentations of a single syndrome and, hence, both should receive equal attention with respect to cancer surveillance.	-1
[mutational spectrum of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and identification of novel mutations in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia in jiangsu province].  to study the characteristics of phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene mutations in patients with hyperphenylalaninemia from jiangsu province by dna sequencing, and to analyze the spectrum of pah gene mutations. a total of 70 patients and their parents were included in this study. all of the 13 exons and flanking introns of the pah gene were analyzed with dna sequencing. forty five types of mutations were identified, which included 4 novel mutations (l37p, h107r, q267l, s391t). a total of 125 mutations were identified in 140 alleles (89.3%). all mutations were detected in exons 2-3, 5-7, 9-12 and introns 2, 4, 7 and 8. most mutations were found in exons 6, 7 and 12. ex6-96a > g, r243q and r241c were the most common mutations. the mutational spectrum of jiangsu province seems to be different from other regions. the spectrum can offer reliable information for genetic diagnosis of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia.	-1
[in vitro expression and structural analysis of four missense mutations (g247s, e280g, p362t, a434d) of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene].  to understand the pathogenic effect and the correlation between the genotype and phenotype of the 4 novel missense mutations (g247s, e280g, p362t and a434d) of phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (pah). (1) the enzyme activity of the 4 mutants was assessed by using transient protein expression in mammalian cells. (2) the pah amino acid sequences among different animal species were alignmented. (3) the effects of the 4 missense mutations on the protein structure were analyzed. (4) the clinical phenotype of the patients with pku were analyzed, according to their blood phe levels prior to treatment and the phe tolerance. (1) the residual enzyme activity expressed in vitro of g247s, e280g, p362t and a434d were 3.1%, 0.4%, 8.2% and 21.7% of the wild-type pah respectively; (2)gly247, glu280 and pro362 were among the highly conserved amino acids, while ala434 was only moderately conserved; (3) as revealed by 3d structural analysis, g247s and e280g, being located at the active center of the enzyme, interfered with the binding of pah to bh4 and ferrousion respectively, while p362t and a434d affected the formation and stability of the dimer and the tetramer of pah; (4) as shown by clinical phenotypic analysis, classical pku were observed in patients carrying g247s and e280g, moderate pku were observed in patients carrying a434d, whereas both classical and moderate pku were observed in patients carrying p362t. (1) the e280g, g247s, p362t and a434d are all disease-causing mutations, with those located at the center of the enzyme displaying the most marked pathogenic effect; (2)the results of the structural analysis of the 3d molecule are consistent with the activity assessment of the enzyme expressed in vitro; (3) the consistency is observed between the genotype, the enzymatic activity expressed in vitro and the clinical phenotype.	1
sodium channel abnormalities are infrequent in patients with long qt syndrome: identification of two novel scn5a mutations.  long qt syndrome (lqts) is a heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations of at least five different loci. three of these, lqt1, lqt2, and lqt5, encode potassium channel subunits. lqt3 encodes the cardiac-specific sodium channel, scn5a. previously reported lqts-associated mutations of scn5a include a recurring three amino acid deletion (deltakpq1505-1507) in four different families, and four different missense mutations. we have examined the scn5a gene in 88 index cases with lqts, including four with jervell and lange-nielsen syndrome and the remainder with romano-ward syndrome. screening portions of diii-div, where mutations have previously been found, showed that none of these patients has the three amino acid deletion, deltakpq1505-1507, or the other four known mutations. we identified a novel missense mutation, t1645m, in the div; s4 voltage sensor immediately adjacent to the previously reported mutation r1644h. we also examined all of the additional pore-forming regions and voltage-sensing regions and discovered another novel mutation, t1304m, at the voltage-sensing region diii; s4. neither t1645m nor t1304m were seen in a panel of unaffected control individuals. five of six t1304m gene carriers were symptomatic. in contrast to previous studies, qt(onset-c) was not a sensitive indicator of scn5a-associated lqts, at least in this family. these data suggest that mutations of scn5a are responsible for only a small proportion of lqts cases.	-1
pku mutations r408q and f299c in norway: haplotype associations, geographic distributions and phenotype characteristics.  details are given concerning the phenylketonuria (pku) mutations r408q and f299c. both mutations were identified among 47 pku patients, derived from the norwegian pku registry. a novel pku mutation (r408q) was identified, by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, on six out of eight mutant haplotype 12 chromosomes and on none of the other pku chromosomes. the f299c mutation occurred exclusively on mutant haplotype 8, and was the only mutation associated with this haplotype (on six chromosomes). one patient homozygous for each mutation was found. the patient homozygous for f299c manifested severe pku, whereas the r408q homozygote exhibited a mild pku variant. pedigree analysis of these families has not, so far, revealed consanguinity. information on the place of birth of the relevant grandparents of the pku patients with these mutations suggests that each of these mutations in norway has originated from a common gene source.	-1
molecular genetics of phenylketonuria in mediterranean countries: a mutation associated with partial phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  we report the characterization of a mutation in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene associated with partial residual activity of the enzyme. this point mutation (280glu----lys) was found by sequencing a mutant cdna clone derived from a needle biopsy of the liver in a child with variant form of phenylketonuria. there is a strict concordance between homozygosity for the mutation and this particular phenotype. the (280glu----lys) mutation is linked to an original and rare rflp haplotype at the pah locus found in south europe and north africa. so far, this genotype-haplotype association is both inclusive and exclusive. thirty-three pah-deficient patients were screened for the mutation by using polymerase chain-reaction amplification of their genomic dna extracted from guthrie cards. since a large number of patients can be screened for a particular mutation by using guthrie cards, the possibility arises of using these samples collected by national newborn screening centers for prospective and retrospective detection of other mutations in the human genome.	1
identification of a variety of mutations in cancer predisposition genes in patients with suspected lynch syndrome.  multigene panels are commercially available tools for hereditary cancer risk assessment that allow for next-generation sequencing of numerous genes in parallel. however, it is not clear if these panels offer advantages over traditional genetic testing. we investigated the number of cancer predisposition gene mutations identified by parallel sequencing in individuals with suspected lynch syndrome. we performed germline analysis with a 25-gene, next-generation sequencing panel using dna from 1260 individuals who underwent clinical genetic testing for lynch syndrome from 2012 through 2013. all patients had a history of lynch syndrome-associated cancer and/or polyps. we classified all identified germline alterations for pathogenicity and calculated the frequencies of pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain clinical significance (vus). we also analyzed data on patients' personal and family history of cancer, including fulfillment of clinical guidelines for genetic testing. of the 1260 patients, 1112 met national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) criteria for lynch syndrome testing (88%; 95% confidence interval [ci], 86%-90%). multigene panel testing identified 114 probands with lynch syndrome mutations (9.0%; 95% ci, 7.6%-10.8%) and 71 with mutations in other cancer predisposition genes (5.6%; 95% ci, 4.4%-7.1%). fifteen individuals had mutations in brca1 or brca2; 93% of these met the nccn criteria for lynch syndrome testing and 33% met nccn criteria for brca1 and brca2 analysis (p = .0017). an additional 9 individuals carried mutations in other genes linked to high lifetime risks of cancer (5 had mutations in apc, 3 had bi-allelic mutations in mutyh, and 1 had a mutation in stk11); all of these patients met nccn criteria for lynch syndrome testing. a total of 479 individuals had 1 or more vus (38%; 95% ci, 35%-41%). in individuals with suspected lynch syndrome, multigene panel testing identified high-penetrance mutations in cancer predisposition genes, many of which were unexpected based on patients' histories. parallel sequencing also detected a high number of potentially uninformative germline findings, including vus.	-1
comprehensive molecular diagnosis of 67 chinese usher syndrome probands: high rate of ethnicity specific mutations in chinese ush patients.  usher syndrome (ush) is the most common disease causing combined deafness and blindness. it is predominantly an autosomal recessive genetic disorder with occasionally digenic cases. molecular diagnosis of ush patients is important for disease management. few studies have tried to find the genetic cause of ush in chinese patients. this study was designed to determine the mutation spectrum of chinese ush patients. we applied next generation sequencing to characterize the mutation spectrum in 67 independent chinese families with at least one member diagnosed with ush. blood was collected at peking union medical college hospital. this cohort is one of the largest ush cohorts reported. we utilized customized panel and whole exome sequencing, variant analysis, sanger validation and segregation tests to find disease causing mutations in these families. we identified biallelic disease causing mutations in known ush genes in 70 % (49) of our patients. as has been previously reported, myo7a is the most frequently mutated gene in our ush type i patients while ush2a is the most mutated gene in our ush type ii patients. in addition, we identify mutations in clrn1, dfnb31, gpr98 and pcdh15 for the first time in chinese ush patients. together, mutations in clrn1, dnfb31, gpr98 and pcdh15 account for 11.4 % of disease in our cohort. interestingly, although the spectrum of disease genes is quite similar between our chinese patient cohort and other patient cohorts from different (and primarily caucasian) ethnic backgrounds, the mutations themselves are dramatically different. in particular, 76 % (52/68) of alleles found in this study have never been previously reported. interestingly, we observed a strong enrichment for severe protein truncating mutations expected to have severe functional consequence on the protein in ush ii patients compared to the reported mutation spectrum in rp patients, who often carry partial protein truncating mutations. our study provides the first comprehensive genetic characterization of a large collection of chinese ush patients. up to 90 % of ush patients have disease caused by mutations in known ush disease genes. by combining ngs-based molecular diagnosis and patient clinical information, a more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and personalized treatment of ush patients can be achieved.	-1
compound heterozygous mutations in the sur1 (abcc 8) subunit of pancreatic k(atp) channels cause neonatal diabetes by perturbing the coupling between kir6.2 and sur1 subunits.  katp channels regulate insulin secretion by coupling ?-cell metabolism to membrane excitability. these channels are comprised of a pore-forming kir6.2 tetramer which is enveloped by four regulatory sur1 subunits. atp acts on kir6.2 to stabilize the channel closed state while adp (coordinated with mg(2+)) activates channels via the sur1 domains. aberrations in nucleotide-binding or in coupling binding to gating can lead to hyperinsulinism or diabetes. here, we report a case of diabetes in a 7-mo old child with compound heterozygous mutations in abcc8 (sur1[a30v] and sur1[g296r]). in unison, these mutations lead to a gain of katp channel function, which will attenuate the ?-cell response to increased metabolism and will thereby decrease insulin secretion. (86)rb(+) flux assays on cosm6 cells coexpressing the mutant subunits (to recapitulate the compound heterozygous state) show a 2-fold increase in basal rate of (86)rb(+) efflux relative to wt channels. experiments on excised inside-out patches also reveal a slight increase in activity, manifested as an enhancement in stimulation by mgadp in channels expressing the compound heterozygous mutations or homozygous g296r mutation. in addition, the ic 50 for atp inhibition of homomeric a30v channels was increased ~6-fold, and was increased ~3-fold for both heteromeric a30v+wt channels or compound heterozygous (a30v +g296r) channels. thus, each mutation makes a mechanistically distinct contribution to the channel gain-of-function that results in neonatal diabetes, and which we predict may contribute to diabetes in related carrier individuals.	1
immune modulation therapy in a crim-positive and igg antibody-positive infant with pompe disease treated with alglucosidase alfa: a case report.  pompe disease is characterized by deficiency or absence of activity of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. as a result of ineffective metabolism, glycogen progressively accumulates in muscle tissues. patients with an aggressive classic infantile-onset form generally rapidly die of cardiorespiratory failure. a cross-reactive immunological material (crim)-negative status is predictive of high anti-alglucosidase alfa antibody titers and usually a poor clinical outcome of enzyme replacement therapy (ert). crim-positive patients can also develop robust antibody titers complicating therapeutic management.we successfully used an immune modulation therapy (imt) protocol in a crim-positive infantile-onset patient with pompe disease in whom infusions had to be temporarily discontinued because of safety concerns despite administration of pre-infusion medication. prior to discontinuation, she had shown signs of clinical deterioration and continuous ventilation support through a tracheostomy was required. she was found to be positive for anti-alglucosidase alfa antibodies (1:6,400). imt (rituximab, methotrexate and intravenous gamma globulin) was started, ert was safely reintroduced during the imt induction phase and, subsequently, the enzyme dose was increased, all without any complications. antibodies disappeared, imt was tapered and discontinued, and cadiomyopathy steadily improved. during 1 year of follow-up, she remained ventilator dependent and no gains in motor skills were noticed; motor functions will be closely monitored during sustained ert.although the reversal of clinical decline in our crim-positive and antibody-positive infant with pompe disease cannot be solely attributed to imt, our experiences with this protocol may be helpful to other physicians encountering comparable therapeutic dilemmas.	-1
fibromyalgia-like symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome: a challenging diagnosis of late-onset pompe disease.  late-onset pompe disease (lopd) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder which usually presents as a limb-girdle myopathy with early respiratory involvement. we report 2 sisters with an uncommon presentation of lopd characterized by fibromyalgia-like pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome. in both sisters, clinical examination was normal and had remained stable for 10 years. the serum creatine kinase level was mildly elevated. several muscle biopsies showed slight nonspecific myopathic abnormalities. a dried blood spot test indicated acid maltase deficiency. the diagnosis of lopd was confirmed genetically. both sisters subsequently developed proximal muscle weakness after pregnancy and started enzyme replacement therapy. under treatment, gastrointestinal symptoms improved, but pain persisted. clinicians should be aware of this atypical presentation of lopd to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment.	-1
a rare presentation of childhood pompe disease: cardiac involvement provoked by epstein-barr virus infection.  myocarditis attributed to epstein-barr virus (ebv) as the sole cause is a rare manifestation. myocarditis ascribed to ebv infection in combination with other factors has been reported in a few more cases. we report a child who experienced active ebv infection and later, at 19 months of age, received a diagnosis of pompe disease (acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency) with predominant cardiac involvement. the cardiac symptoms resolved at the end of the ebv infection. when the patient was recently seen, at 8 years of age, she had an increased left ventricular wall thickness but normal cardiac function. dna analysis identified this patient as compound heterozygote for a mutant tyr292cys and a null allele. in light of genotype-phenotype correlation, it is notable that a spanish patient with a functionally similar genotype (tyr292cys/arg854stop) also had childhood pompe disease with peripheral muscular involvement.	1
germ line p53 mutations in a familial syndrome of breast cancer, sarcomas, and other neoplasms.  familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer. the dominantly inherited li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals. the rarity and high mortality of lfs precluded formal linkage analysis. the alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene. the tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with lfs. germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five lfs families analyzed. these mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein. the frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with lfs, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation.	-1
re-evaluation casts doubt on the pathogenicity of homozygous ush2a p.c759f.  mutations in ush2a are a common cause of retinitis pigmentosa (rp). among the most frequently reported ush2a variants, c.2276g>t (p.c759f) has been found in both affected and healthy individuals. the pathogenicity of this variant remains controversial since it was detected in homozygosity in two healthy siblings of a spanish family (s23), eleven years ago. the fact that these individuals remain asymptomatic today, prompted us to study the presence of other pathogenic variants in this family using targeted resequencing of 26 retinal genes in one of the affected individuals. this approach allowed us to identify one novel pathogenic homozygous mutation in exon 13 of pde6b (c.1678c>t; p.r560c). this variant cosegregated with the disease and was absent in 200 control individuals. remarkably, the identified variant in pde6b corresponds to the mutation responsible of the retinal degeneration in the naturally occurring rd10 mutant mice. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of the rd10 mice mutation in a rp family. these findings, together with a review of the literature, support the hypothesis that homozygous p.c759f mutations are not pathogenic and led us to exclude the implication of p.c759f in the rp of family s23. our results indicate the need of re-evaluating all families genetically diagnosed with this mutation.	-1
screening of mutations in the gck gene in jordanian maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (mody2) patients.  maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 2 (mody2) is a genetic form of diabetes mellitus caused by mutations in the glucokinase gene (gck). we assessed the frequency of gck gene mutations in jordanian suspected mody2 patients. we screened exons 7, 8 and 9, which are specific for pancreatic glucokinase, for mutations at positions 682a>g, p.t228a; 895g>c, p.g299r, and 1148c>a, p.s383x, respectively, in 250 subjects (100 patients suspected to have mody2 and 150 healthy controls without family history of diabetes mellitus). we did not find any association of these mutations in jordanian suspected mody2 patients or in healthy controls, different from data on caucasian italian patients screened for the same mutations.	-1
mutation profile of the gaa gene in 40 italian patients with late onset glycogen storage disease type ii.  glycogen storage disease type ii (gsdii) is a recessively inherited disorder due to the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (gaa) that results in impaired glycogen degradation and its accumulation in the lysosomes. we report here the complete molecular analysis of the gaa gene performed on 40 italian patients with late onset gsdii. twelve novel alleles have been identified: missense mutations were functionally characterized by enzyme activity and protein processing in a human gaa-deficient cell line while splicing mutations were studied by rt-pcr and in silico analysis. a complex allele was also identified carrying three different alterations in cis. the c.-32-13t > g was the most frequent mutation, present as compound heterozygote in 85% of the patients (allele frequency 42.3%), as described in other late onset gsdii caucasian populations. interestingly, the c.-32-13t > g was associated with the c.2237g > a (p.w746x) in nine of the 40 patients. genotype-phenotype correlations are discussed with particular emphasis on the subgroup carrying the c.-32-13t > g/c.2237g > a genotype.	1
germ-line mutations of tp53 in li-fraumeni families: an extended study of 39 families.  we have previously reported on the analysis of tp53 coding mutations in 12 classic li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) families plus 9 families that were li-fraumeni-like (lfl) families (j. m. birch et al., cancer res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994). mutations were found in 6 of 12 lfs families and in 1 of 9 lfl families. we have now extended these studies to include an additional nine lfs and nine lfl families, and tp53 mutations have been detected in eight of nine lfs families and in three of nine lfl families. six of the new mutations described here are the same as those previously identified in other li-fraumeni families and are missense mutations at codons 245, 248, and 273 (in two families); a nonsense mutation at codon 209; and a mutation at the splice donor site in exon 4. the other five mutations are novel germ-line mutations and include missense mutations at codons 136 and 344, a 2-bp deletion within codon 191, a splice acceptor mutation in intron 3, and a 167-bp deletion of part of exon 1 and intron 1. in addition, we have detected a codon 175 mutation in a family previously reported as tp53 negative. to summarize all of the data from the families we have studied in this and our previous report (j. m. birch et al., cancer res., 54: 1298-1304, 1994), mutations have been detected in 15 of 21 lfs families (71%) and in 4 of 18 lfl families (22%). these figures are somewhat higher than those previously reported by us and others for the frequency of tp53 mutations in lfs and lfl families. this could reflect our analysis of all 11 exons of tp53, including noncoding regions, as well as the use of direct sequencing rather than other less-sensitive mutation detection methods.	-1
"bag3 myofibrillar myopathy presenting with cardiomyopathy.  myofibrillar myopathies (mfms) are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders distinguished by the pathological hallmark of myofibrillar dissolution. most patients present in adulthood, but mutations in several genes including bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (bag3) cause predominantly childhood-onset disease. bag3-related mfm is particularly severe, featuring weakness, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and early lethality. while prior cases reported either neuromuscular weakness or concurrent weakness and cardiomyopathy at onset, we describe the first case in which cardiomyopathy and cardiac transplantation (age eight) preceded neuromuscular weakness by several years (age 12). the phenotype comprised distal weakness and severe sensorimotor neuropathy. nerve biopsy was primarily axonal with secondary demyelinating/remyelinating changes without ""giant axons."" muscle biopsy showed extensive neuropathic changes that made myopathic changes difficult to interpret. similar to previous cases, a p.pro209leu mutation in exon 3 of bag3 was found. this case underlines the importance of evaluating for mfms in patients with combined neuromuscular weakness and cardiomyopathy."	-1
genotype and phenotype in fabry disease: analysis of the fabry outcome survey.  mutations of the gene (gla) encoding alpha-galactosidase a are implicated in fabry disease, a progressive, x-chromosomal inherited lysosomal storage disorder. fos--the fabry outcome survey - was established as a long-term surveillance study to describe the natural course of fabry disease and its response to enzyme replacement therapy in a large cohort of european patients. clinical phenotype, age of onset and course of fabry disease are very variable, even within the same family, which makes it difficult to define a genotype-phenotype relationship by analysing individual patients. the fos database contains detailed medical information on a large cohort of patients and thus has the potential to provide important information to address this question. at the time of analysis, information on 545 patients belonging to 157 families from nine european countries had been entered into the fos database. a gla mutation has been reported in 365 individuals (65% and 68% of all males and females, respectively) in fos. these data were used to analyse the relationship between genotype and phenotype in fabry disease. a highly significant positive correlation was found between the age at entry into fos and the fos severity index in male patients with gla missense mutations (p < 0.001) as well as in those carrying other types of mutations (p < 0.001). a positive correlation was also found between the age at entry into fos and the number of affected organs in male patients with missense mutations, irrespective of whether the change in the amino acid side chain predicted in the alpha-galactosidase a protein was classified as a conservative or non-conservative change. the data presented here suggest that there is a correlation between genotype and clinical severity.	-1
mutations of the light meromyosin domain of the beta-myosin heavy chain rod in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is caused by mutations in 9 sarcomeric protein genes. the most commonly affected is beta-myosin heavy chain (myh7), where missense mutations cluster in the head and neck regions and directly affect motor function. comparable mutations have not been described in the light meromyosin (lmm) region of the myosin rod, nor would these be expected to directly affect motor function. we studied 82 probands with hcm in whom no mutations had been found in myh7 exons encoding the head and neck regions of myosin nor in the other frequently implicated disease genes. primers were designed to amplify exons 24 to 40 of myh7. these amplimers were subjected to temperature modulated heteroduplex analysis by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. an ala1379thr missense mutation in exon 30 segregated with disease in three families and was not present in 200 normal chromosomes. the mutation occurred on two haplotypes, indicating that it was not a polymorphism linked with another disease-causing mutation. the position of this residue within the lmm region of myosin suggests that it may be important for thick filament assembly or for accessory protein binding. a further missense mutation in exon 37, ser1776gly, segregated with disease in a single family and was absent from 400 population-matched control chromosomes. because the ser1776 residue occupies a core position in the myosin rod at which the substitution of glycine is extremely energetically unfavorable, it is likely to disrupt the coiled-coil structure. we conclude that mutation of the lmm can cause hcm and that such mutations may act through novel mechanisms of disease pathogenesis involving myosin filament assembly or interaction with thick filament binding proteins.	-1
a case of childhood pompe disease demonstrating phenotypic variability of p.asp645asn.  a six-year-old child presented at 8 months of age with proximal muscle weakness and mild cardiac hypertrophy. some alpha-glucosidase activity was detected in muscle but not in fibroblasts. as none of the two pathogenic mutations, [c.1933g>a]+[c.2702t>a] (asp645asn/leu901gln), led to detectable alpha-glucosidase activity upon expression in cos cells, the phenotype of the patient remained unexplained. a functionally comparable set of mutations, asp645asn/insgnt2243, was reported previously to cause classic infantile pompe disease [biochem biophys res commun 244 (1998) 921]. we conclude that secondary genetic or environmental factors can be decisive for the phenotypic outcome of classic infantile versus childhood pompe disease, when the acid alpha-glucosidase activity is extremely low.	1
exome sequencing identifies potential risk variants for mendelian disorders at high prevalence in qatar.  exome sequencing of families of related individuals has been highly successful in identifying genetic polymorphisms responsible for mendelian disorders. here, we demonstrate the value of the reverse approach, where we use exome sequencing of a sample of unrelated individuals to analyze allele frequencies of known causal mutations for mendelian diseases. we sequenced the exomes of 100 individuals representing the three major genetic subgroups of the qatari population (q1 bedouin, q2 persian-south asian, q3 african) and identified 37 variants in 33 genes with effects on 36 clinically significant mendelian diseases. these include variants not present in 1000 genomes and variants at high frequency when compared with 1000 genomes populations. several of these mendelian variants were only segregating in one qatari subpopulation, where the observed subpopulation specificity trends were confirmed in an independent population of 386 qataris. premarital genetic screening in qatar tests for only four out of the 37, such that this study provides a set of mendelian disease variants with potential impact on the epidemiological profile of the population that could be incorporated into the testing program if further experimental and clinical characterization confirms high penetrance.	-1
evaluation of germline pten mutations in endometrial cancer patients.  cowden syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas, increased risks of breast and thyroid cancers, and possibly endometrial carcinoma. susceptibility to cowden syndrome is conferred by germline mutation of the pten tumor suppressor gene, and somatic mutations of pten are common in sporadic endometrial carcinomas. the aim of this study was to test whether a substantial proportion of endometrial cancers are associated with germline mutations of the pten gene, not necessarily in association with clinically overt cowden syndrome. a retrospective cohort of 240 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed endometrial carcinoma diagnosed at our institution from 1999 to 2002 was ascertained for study. genomic dna was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and the entire pten coding region and exon-intron junctions were screened for mutations by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. potential variants were subjected to direct sequence analysis. no clearly deleterious pten sequence variant was identified in this screened cohort of endometrial cancer patients. one patient harbored a 5-bp deletion in the intronic region adjacent to the splice acceptor site of pten exon 4, but this variant has been previously classified as a rare polymorphism. although these data do not preclude the possibility of an increased risk of endometrial cancer in association with the cowden syndrome, they indicate that germline pten mutations do not account for a significant proportion of genetic attributable risk for endometrial carcinoma.	-1
clinical and prognostic evaluation of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in two south african families with different cardiac beta myosin heavy chain gene mutations.  familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiac disorder, with sudden cardiac death at a young age the most frequent cause of death in affected individuals. some cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are caused by missense mutations of the beta myosin heavy chain (beta mhc) gene on chromosome 14 and at least 17 such mutations have been described. recent reports suggest that a correlation exists between a specific beta mhc gene mutation and prognosis in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this premise is currently being used as a basis to provide counselling for affected families. this mutation/prognosis association, however, has not been widely assessed as yet. the clinical and prognostic features of two south african families of mixed racial descent, in which different beta mhc gene mutations were segregating, were studied to evaluate this correlation. the results were compared with those of previously published reports of european families carrying the same mutations. the beta mhc gene missense mutations in two affected families were identified by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing (pedigree 106: arg403trp; pedigree 108: arg249gln). all family members were subjected to genotypic analysis using polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme based mutation detection techniques. clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic studies were performed on genotypically affected individuals in these two kindreds. the number of individuals identified in pedigree 106 with the arg403trp mutation was 32.10 individuals bore the arg249gln mutation in pedigree 108. the penetrance rate in adults (equal to or greater than 16 years), using the strict echocardiographic criterion of maximum left ventricular wall thickness > or = 13 mm, was 25% for pedigree 106 and 33% for pedigree 108. familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy compatible electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities were seen in 60% of genotypically positive individuals aged > or = 16 years in pedigree 106 and 80% in pedigree 108. the prognosis was uniformly benign in the two families. for pedigree 106 this corresponded to a report of no early sudden cardiac deaths in a french family with the arg403trp mutation. for pedigree 108 the absence of such deaths was in apparent contrast to the four cases reported in 24 genotypically affected individuals in a study of a kindred of european ancestry bearing the arg249gln mutation. this study of a large south african kindred confirmed the benign nature of the arg403trp mutation suggested in a previous report. the number and the relatively young age of affected individuals in a second south african family must be considered when comparing the absence of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated deaths with the intermediate survival reported for the arg249gln mutation in a european family. this investigation lends support to current evidence relating specific beta mhc gene mutations to prognosis, which may be used as a basis to provide counselling for affected families.	-1
characterization of cryptic splicing in germline pten intronic variants in cowden syndrome.  germline mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene pten predispose to subsets of cowden syndrome (cs), bannayan-riley-ruvalcaba syndrome, and autism. evidence-based classification of pten variants as either deleterious or benign is urgently needed for accurate molecular diagnosis and gene-informed genetic counseling. we studied 34 different germline pten intronic variants from 61 cs patients, characterized their pten mrna processing, and analyzed pten expression and downstream readouts of p-akt and p-erk1/2. while we found that many mutations near splice junctions result in exon skipping, we also identified the presence of cryptic splicing that resulted in premature termination or a shift in isoform usage. pten protein expression is significantly lower in the group with splicing changes while p-akt, but not p-erk1/2, is significantly increased. our observations of these pten intronic variants should contribute to the determination of pathogenicity of pten intronic variants and aid in genetic counseling.	1
lysosome-associated protein 1 (lamp-1) and lysosome-associated protein 2 (lamp-2) in a larger family carrier of fabry disease.  this study investigated the potential relationship between the expression levels of lysosome-associated membrane proteins (lamp) 1 and 2 and responses to enzyme replacement therapy (ert) in the members of a single family with fabry disease (fd). lamp levels were assessed by flow cytometry in leukocytes from 17 fd patients who received an eight-month course of ert course and 101 healthy individuals. we found that phagocytic cells from the fd patients had higher expression levels of both lamp-1 and lamp-2, relative to the levels in phagocytes from the healthy controls (p=0.001). furthermore, the lamp-1 and lamp-2 levels in phagocytes from the fd carriers continuously decreased with ert administration to reach levels similar to those in healthy controls. we suggest that lamp-1 and lamp-2 could be used as additional markers with which to assess ert effectiveness in fd.	1
a functional dissection of pten n-terminus: implications in pten subcellular targeting and tumor suppressor activity.  spatial regulation of the tumor suppressor pten is exerted through alternative plasma membrane, cytoplasmic, and nuclear subcellular locations. the n-terminal region of pten is important for the control of pten subcellular localization and function. it contains both an active nuclear localization signal (nls) and an overlapping pip2-binding motif (pbm) involved in plasma membrane targeting. we report a comprehensive mutational and functional analysis of the pten n-terminus, including a panel of tumor-related mutations at this region. nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning in mammalian cells and pip3 phosphatase assays in reconstituted s. cerevisiae defined categories of pten n-terminal mutations with distinct pip3 phosphatase and nuclear accumulation properties. noticeably, most tumor-related mutations that lost pip3 phosphatase activity also displayed impaired nuclear localization. cell proliferation and soft-agar colony formation analysis in mammalian cells of mutations with distinctive nuclear accumulation and catalytic activity patterns suggested a contribution of both properties to pten tumor suppressor activity. our functional dissection of the pten n-terminus provides the basis for a systematic analysis of tumor-related and experimentally engineered pten mutations.	1
maturity-onset diabetes of the young with end-stage nephropathy: a new indication for simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation?  background and case: simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantation (spk) is applied almost exclusively in c-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic patients, although some data on spk in type 2 diabetes have been published as well. nothing is known about spk in the autosomal diabetes form, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody). spk was performed in a 47-year old man who has mody3 because of a arg272his mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alphagene. he developed overt diabetes mellitus at 19 years and end-stage diabetic nephropathy 26 years thereafter. before spk, the patient had measurable fasting serum c-peptide levels, but lacked beta-cell response to intravenous glucose and glucagon. he was treated with 34 iu of insulin per day. at 2 years post-transplantation, the patient remains normoglycemic and insulin independent. a hyperglycemic clamp test showed a normal beta-cell function. identification of mody3 among all c-peptide-positive patients with advanced diabetic nephropathy might help to select a specific group profiting from spk.	-1
a novel de novo cdh1 germline variant aids in the classification of carboxy-terminal e-cadherin alterations predicted to escape nonsense-mediated mrna decay.  most truncating cadherin 1 (cdh1) pathogenic alterations confer an elevated lifetime risk of diffuse gastric cancer (dgc) and lobular breast cancer (lbc). however, transcripts containing carboxy-terminal premature stop codons have been demonstrated to escape the nonsense-mediated mrna decay pathway, and gastric and breast cancer risks associated with these truncations should be carefully evaluated. a female patient underwent multigene panel testing because of a personal history of invasive lbc diagnosed at age 54, which identified the germlinecdh1 nonsense alteration, c.2506g>t (p.glu836*), in the last exon of the gene. subsequent parental testing for the alteration was negative and additional short tandem repeat analysis confirmed the familial relationships and the de novo occurrence in the proband. based on the de novo occurrence, clinical history, and rarity in general population databases, this alteration was classified as a likely pathogenic variant. this is the most carboxy-terminal pathogenic alteration reported to date. additionally, this alteration contributed to the classification of six other upstreamcdh1 carboxy-terminal truncating variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. identifying the most distal pathogenic alteration provides evidence to classify other carboxy-terminal truncating variants as either pathogenic or benign, a fundamental step to offering presymptomatic screening and prophylactic procedures to the appropriate patients.	-1
a structural systems biology approach for quantifying the systemic consequences of missense mutations in proteins.  gauging the systemic effects of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nssnps) is an important topic in the pursuit of personalized medicine. however, it is a non-trivial task to understand how a change at the protein structure level eventually affects a cell's behavior. this is because complex information at both the protein and pathway level has to be integrated. given that the idea of integrating both protein and pathway dynamics to estimate the systemic impact of missense mutations in proteins remains predominantly unexplored, we investigate the practicality of such an approach by formulating mathematical models and comparing them with experimental data to study missense mutations. we present two case studies: (1) interpreting systemic perturbation for mutations within the cell cycle control mechanisms (g2 to mitosis transition) for yeast; (2) phenotypic classification of neuron-related human diseases associated with mutations within the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathway. we show that the application of simplified mathematical models is feasible for understanding the effects of small sequence changes on cellular behavior. furthermore, we show that the systemic impact of missense mutations can be effectively quantified as a combination of protein stability change and pathway perturbation.	1
natural phenylalanine hydroxylase variants that confer a mild phenotype affect the enzyme's conformational stability and oligomerization equilibrium.  hyperphenylalaninemias are genetic diseases prevalently caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene. the wild-type pah enzyme is a homotetramer regulated by its substrate, cofactor and phosphorylation. we reproduced a full-length wild-type protein and seven natural full-length pah variants, p.i65m, p.n223y, p.r297l, p.f382l, p.k398n, p.a403v, and p.q419r, and analyzed their biochemical and biophysical behavior. all mutants exhibited reduced enzymatic activity, namely from 38% to 69% of wild-type activity. biophysical characterization was performed by size-exclusion chromatography, light scattering and circular dichroism. in the purified wild-type pah, we identified the monomer in equilibrium with the dimer and tetramer. in most mutants, the equilibrium shifted toward the dimer and most tended to form aggregates. all pah variants displayed different biophysical behaviors due to loss of secondary structure and thermal destabilization. specifically, p.f382l was highly unstable at physiological temperature. moreover, using confocal microscopy with the number and brightness technique, we studied the effect of bh4 addition directly in living human cells expressing wild-type pah or p.a403v, a mild mutant associated with bh4 responsiveness in vivo. our results demonstrate that bh4 addition promotes re-establishment of the oligomerization equilibrium, thus indicating that the dimer-to-tetramer shift in pa403v plays a key role in bh4 responsiveness. in conclusion, we show that the oligomerization process and conformational stability are altered by mutations that could affect the physiological behavior of the enzyme. this endorses the hypothesis that oligomerization and folding defects of pah variants are the most common causes of hpas, particularly as regards mild human phenotypes.	1
klln epigenotype-phenotype associations in cowden syndrome.  germline klln promoter hypermethylation was recently identified as a potential genetic etiology of the cancer predisposition syndrome, cowden syndrome (cs), when no causal pten gene mutation was found. we screened for klln promoter methylation in a large prospective series of cs patients and determined the risk of benign and malignant cs features in patients with increased methylation both with and without a pten mutation/variant of unknown significance. in all, 1012 cs patients meeting relaxed international cowden consortium criteria including 261 pten mutation-positive cs patients, 187 pten variant-positive cs patients and 564 pten mutation-negative cs patients, as well as 111 population controls were assessed for germline klln promoter methylation by massarray epityper analysis. klln promoter methylation was analyzed both as a continuous and a dichotomous variable in the calculation of phenotypic risks by stepwise logistic regression and kaplan-meier/standardized incidence ratio methods, respectively. significantly increased klln promoter methylation was seen in cs individuals with and without a pten mutation/vus compared with controls (p<0.001). patients with high klln promoter methylation have increased risks of all cs-associated malignancies compared with the general population. interestingly, klln-associated risk of thyroid cancer appears to be gender and pten status dependent. klln promoter methylation associated with different benign phenotypes dependent on pten status. furthermore, increasing klln promoter methylation is associated with a greater phenotype burden in mutation-negative cs patients. germline promoter hypermethylation of klln is associated with particular malignant and benign cs features, which is dependent on the pten mutation status.	-1
fabry disease: a new approach for the screening of females in high-risk groups.  fabry disease (fd) is a rare x-linked inborn error of metabolism caused by deficient activity of lysosomal ?-galactosidase a (?-gal). due to random x inactivation, ?-gal activity in heterozygous females ranges from very low to overlapping normal values. determining this specific range and altering assays cutoffs could become a valuable tool for minimizing the need in dna sequencing for screening of all potential carriers. therefore, the aim of this study was to establish the range of enzyme in dried blood spots (dbs), plasma and leukocytes that suggests carrier status for fd. ?-gal gene was sequenced in 453 women with clinical suspicion and/or positive family history of fd. this data was compared to the ?-gal activity measured in dbs (dried blood spots) and/or plasma and/or leukocytes. about 12% of the samples had pathogenic mutations (c.30_32delg, c.718_719delaa, p.r118c, p.s126g, p.y152x, p.a156d, p.c202y, p.n215s, p.p259r, p.d264y, p.v269m, p.r342q and p.r356w). when compared to genotype, dbs was the least reliable biochemical test for screening, with very low specificity. plasma and leukocyte activities presented high auc in roc curve analysis, both over 84%. when cutoffs were altered to identify all carriers, leukocyte specificity was higher than that of plasma (35.2% and 27.6%, respectively). moderated correlation and agreement coefficients were found between them, which reinforces the need for using both data combined. a combined approach involving plasma and leukocyte ?-gal activities, with distinct cutoffs for men and women, could represent a more accurate, faster and less expensive tool to screen women for fd in high-risk groups in middle- and low-income countries.	-1
combined genetic approaches yield a 48% diagnostic rate in a large cohort of french hearing-impaired patients.  hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder and because of its high genetic heterogeneity, implementation of massively parallel sequencing (mps) in diagnostic laboratories is greatly improving the possibilities of offering optimal care to patients. we present the results of a two-year period of molecular diagnosis that included 207 french families referred for non-syndromic hearing loss. our multi-step strategy involved (i) dfnb1 locus analysis, (ii) mps of 74 genes, and (iii) additional approaches including copy number variations, in silico analyses, minigene studies coupled when appropriate with complete gene sequencing, and a specific assay for strc. this comprehensive screening yielded an overall diagnostic rate of 48%, equally distributed between dfnb1 (24%) and the other genes (24%). pathogenic genotypes were identified in 19 different genes, with a high prevalence of gjb2, strc, myo15a, otof, tmc1, myo7a and ush2a. involvement of an usher gene was reported in 16% of the genotyped cohort. four de novo variants were identified. this study highlights the need to develop several molecular approaches for efficient molecular diagnosis of hearing loss, as this is crucial for genetic counselling, audiological rehabilitation and the detection of syndromic forms.	-1
fabry disease: thirty-five mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a gene in patients with classic and variant phenotypes.  fabry disease, an x-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid catabolism, results from mutations in the alpha-galactosidase a (alpha-gal a) gene located at xq22.1. to determine the nature and frequency of the molecular lesions causing the classical and milder variant fabry phenotypes and for precise carrier detection, the alpha-gal a lesions in 42 unrelated fabry hemizygotes were determined. genomic dna was isolated from affected probands and their family members. the seven alpha-galactosidase a exons and flanking intronic sequences were pcr amplified and the nucleotide sequence was determined by solid-phase direct sequencing. two patients with the mild cardiac phenotype had missense mutations, i9it and f113l, respectively. in 38 classically affected patients, 33 new mutations were identified including 20 missense (mit, a31v, h46r, y86c, l89p, d92y, c94y, a97v, r100t, y134s, g138r, a143t, s148r, g163v, d170v, c202y, y216d, n263s, w287c, and n298s), two nonsense (q386x, w399x), one splice site mutation (ivs4 + 2t-->c), and eight small exonic insertions or deletions (304del1, 613del9, 777del1, 1057del2, 1074del2, 1077del1, 1212del3, and 1094ins1), which identified exon 7 as a region prone to gene rearrangements. in addition, two unique complex rearrangements consisting of contiguous small insertions and deletions were found in exons 1 and 2 causing l45r/h46s and l120x, respectively. these studies further define the heterogeneity of mutations causing fabry disease, permit precise carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis in these families, and facilitate the identification of candidates for enzyme replacement therapy.	-1
functional and structural characterization of novel mutations and genotype-phenotype correlation in 51 phenylalanine hydroxylase deficient families from southern italy.  hyperphenylalaninemia (online mendelian inheritance in man database: 261600) is an autosomal recessive disorder mainly due to mutations in the gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase; the most severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia is classic phenylketonuria. we sequenced the entire gene for phenylalanine hydroxylase in 51 unrelated hyperphenylalaninemia patients from southern italy. the entire locus was genotyped in 46 out of 51 hyperphenylalaninemia patients, and 32 different disease-causing mutations were identified. the pathologic nature of two novel gene variants, namely, c.707-2dela and p.q301p, was demonstrated by in vitro studies. c.707-2dela is a splicing mutation that involves the accepting site of exon 7; it causes the complete skipping of exon 7 and results in the truncated p.t236mfsx60 protein. the second gene variant, p.q301p, has very low residual enzymatic activity (approximately 4.4%), which may be ascribed, in part, to a low expression level (8-10%). both the decreased enzyme activity and the low expression level are supported by analysis of the 3d structure of the molecule. the putative structural alterations induced by p.q301p are compatible with protein instability and perturbance of monomer interactions within dimers and tetramers, although they do not affect the catalytic site. in vivo studies showed tetrahydrobiopterin responsiveness in the p.q301p carrier but not in the c.707-2dela carrier. we next investigated genotype-phenotype correlations and found that genotype was a good predictor of phenotype in 76% of patients. however, genotype-phenotype discordance occurred in approximately 25% of our patients, mainly those bearing mutations p.l48s, p.r158q, p.r261q and p.p281l.	-1
identification of slc26a4 c.919-2a>g compound heterozygosity in hearing-impaired patients to improve genetic counseling.  mutations in the slc26a4 gene, which encodes the anion transporter, pendrin, are a major cause of autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (nshl) in some asian populations. slc26a4 c.919-2a>g (ivs7-2a>g) is the most common mutation in east asian deaf populations. to provide a basis for improving the clinical diagnosis of deaf patients, we evaluated 80 patients with the slc26a4 c.919-2a>g monoallelic mutation from 1065 hearing-impaired subjects and reported the occurrence of a second mutant allele in these patients. the occurrence of a second mutant allele in these 80 patients with a single c.919-2a>g mutation was investigated. mutation screening was performed by bidirectional sequencing in slc26a4 exons 2 to 6 and 9 to 21. we found that 47/80 patients carried another slc26a4 c.919-2a>g compound mutation. the five most common mutations were: p.h723r, p.t410m, 15+5g>a (c.1705+5g>a), p.l676q and p.n392y. we found a chinese-specific slc26a4 mutation spectrum and an associated slc26a4 contribution to deafness. our study illustrates that mutation analysis of other slc26a4 exons should be undertaken in deaf patients with a single heterozygous slc26a4 mutation. moreover, a model of compound heterozygosity may partially explain the disease phenotype.	-1
hrpt2, encoding parafibromin, is mutated in hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome.  we report here the identification of a gene associated with the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor (hpt-jt) syndrome. a single locus associated with hpt-jt (hrpt2) was previously mapped to chromosomal region 1q25-q32. we refined this region to a critical interval of 12 cm by genotyping in 26 affected kindreds. using a positional candidate approach, we identified thirteen different heterozygous, germline, inactivating mutations in a single gene in fourteen families with hpt-jt. the proposed role of hrpt2 as a tumor suppressor was supported by mutation screening in 48 parathyroid adenomas with cystic features, which identified three somatic inactivating mutations, all located in exon 1. none of these mutations were detected in normal controls, and all were predicted to cause deficient or impaired protein function. hrpt2 is a ubiquitously expressed, evolutionarily conserved gene encoding a predicted protein of 531 amino acids, for which we propose the name parafibromin. our findings suggest that hrpt2 is a tumor-suppressor gene, the inactivation of which is directly involved in predisposition to hpt-jt and in development of some sporadic parathyroid tumors.	-1
frequency of germline mutations in 25 cancer susceptibility genes in a sequential series of patients with breast cancer.  testing for germline mutations in brca1/2 is standard for select patients with breast cancer to guide clinical management. next-generation sequencing (ngs) allows testing for mutations in additional breast cancer predisposition genes. the frequency of germline mutations detected by using ngs has been reported in patients with breast cancer who were referred for brca1/2 testing or with triple-negative breast cancer. we assessed the frequency and predictors of mutations in 25 cancer predisposition genes, including brca1/2, in a sequential series of patients with breast cancer at an academic institution to examine the utility of genetic testing in this population. patients with stages i to iii breast cancer who were seen at a single cancer center between 2010 and 2012, and who agreed to participate in research dna banking, were included (n = 488). personal and family cancer histories were collected and germline dna was sequenced with ngs to identify mutations. deleterious mutations were identified in 10.7% of women, including 6.1% in brca1/2 (5.1% in non-ashkenazi jewish patients) and 4.6% in other breast/ovarian cancer predisposition genes including chek2 (n = 10), atm (n = 4), brip1 (n = 4), and one each in palb2, pten, nbn, rad51c, rad51d, msh6, and pms2. whereas young age (p < .01), ashkenazi jewish ancestry (p < .01), triple-negative breast cancer (p = .01), and family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p = .01) predicted for brca1/2 mutations, no factors predicted for mutations in other breast cancer predisposition genes. among sequential patients with breast cancer, 10.7% were found to have a germline mutation in a gene that predisposes women to breast or ovarian cancer, using a panel of 25 predisposition genes. factors that predict for brca1/2 mutations do not predict for mutations in other breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes when these genes are analyzed as a single group. additional cohorts will be helpful to define individuals at higher risk of carrying mutations in genes other than brca1/2.	-1
nmr-based functional profiling of rasopathies and oncogenic ras mutations.  defects in the ras small g protein or its associated network of regulatory proteins that disrupt gtpase cycling are a major cause of cancer and developmental rasopathy disorders. lack of robust functional assays has been a major hurdle in ras pathway-targeted drug development. we used nmr to obtain detailed mechanistic data on ras cycling defects conferred by oncogenic mutations, or full-length rasopathy-derived regulatory proteins. by monitoring the conformation of wild-type and oncogenic ras in real-time, we show that opposing properties integrate with regulators to hyperactivate oncogenic ras mutants. q61l and g13d exhibited rapid nucleotide exchange and an unexpected susceptibility to gap-mediated hydrolysis, in direct contrast with g12v, indicating different approaches must be taken to inhibit these oncoproteins. an nmr methodology was established to directly monitor ras cycling by intact, multidomain proteins encoded by rasopathy genes in mammalian cell extracts. by measuring gap activity from tumor cells, we demonstrate how loss of neurofibromatosis type 1 (nf1) increases ras-gtp levels in nf1-derived cells. we further applied this methodology to profile noonan syndrome (ns)-derived sos1 mutants. combining nmr with cell-based assays allowed us to differentiate defects in catalysis, allosteric regulation, and membrane targeting of individual mutants, while revealing a membrane-dependent compensatory effect that attenuates dramatic increases in ras activation shown by y337c, l550p, and i252t. our nmr method presents a precise and robust measure of ras activity, providing mechanistic insights that facilitate discovery of therapeutics targeted against the ras signaling network.	1
impact of genetic defects on atherosclerosis in patients suspected of familial hypercholesterolaemia.  among patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and a family history of early cardiovascular disease, we assessed whether patients with mutations of low-density lipoprotein (ldl) receptor and apolipoprotein b genes related to familial hypercholesterolaemia (fh) have a different degree of atherosclerosis than those without such mutations. in our lipid clinics, 273 patients were selected on the basis of a severe hypercholesterolaemia (cholesterol above 95th percentile) and a family history of early cardiovascular disease. by molecular genetic test, 122 patients were classified as fh. atherosclerosis was evaluated by the ultrasonographic measurement of intima-media thickness (imt) in the carotid and femoral arteries. despite the fact that non-fh individuals had a higher prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes and hypertriglyceridaemia, fh individuals had significantly greater carotid and femoral imt than non-fh patients: difference between carotid and femoral imt, respectively, 0.19 mm (95% ci, 0.08-0.29; p < 0.001) and 0.20 mm (95% ci, 0.09-0.35; p = 0.001), respectively. these differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for the various risk factors as well as in sub-analysis restricted to the patients with ldl-cholesterol between 240 and 300 mg dl-1 (range with similar distribution in the two groups). when classified according to the severity of their mutations, fh individuals with null ldl receptor allele tended to have thicker carotid imt than fh individuals carrying the ldl receptor-defective allele. among patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and a family history of early cardiovascular disease, the presence of a genetically ascertained fh is associated with a higher degree of atherosclerosis. this suggests that molecular genetic identification of fh may be helpful to evaluate better the coronary heart disease risk in these patients.	-1
molecular genetics of tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) gene result in phenylketonuria (pku). tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4))-responsive hyperphenylalaninemia has been recently described as a variant of pah deficiency caused by specific mutations in the pah gene. it has been suggested that bh(4)-responsiveness may be predicted from the corresponding genotypes. data from bh(4) loading tests indicated an incidence of bh(4)-responsiveness of >40% in the general pku population and >80% in mild pku patients. the current project entailed genotype analysis of 315 bh(4)-responsive patients tabulated in the biopkudb database and comparison with the data from the pahdb locus-specific knowledgebase, as well as with previously published pah mutations for several european countries, northern china, and south korea. we identified 57 mutations, presenting with a substantial residual pah activity (average approximately 47%), presumed to be associated with bh(4)-responsiveness. more than 89% of patients are found to be compound heterozygotes. the three most common mutations found in >5% of bh(4)-responsive patients are p.a403 v, p.r261q, and p.y414c. using the hardy-weinberg formula the predicted average frequency of bh(4)-responsiveness in european populations was calculated to be 55% (range 17-79%, lowest in baltic countries and poland and highest in spain), 57% in northern china, and 55% for south korea. the genotype-predicted prevalence of bh(4)-responsiveness was higher than prevalence data obtained from bh(4) loading tests. inconsistent results were observed for mutations p.l48s, p.i65 t, p.r158q, p.r261q, and p.y414c. our data suggest that bh(4)-responsiveness may be more common than assumed and to some extent may be predicted or excluded from the patient's genotype.	1
novel coch p.v123e mutation, causative of dfna9 sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular disorder, shows impaired cochlin post-translational cleavage and secretion.  dfna9 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by late-onset, non-syndromic hearing loss, and vestibular dysfunction. mutations in the coch (coagulation factor c homology) gene encoding cochlin are etiologically linked to dfna9. previous studies have shown that cochlin is cleaved by aggrecanase-1 during inflammation in the spleen and that the cleaved lccl domain functions as an innate immune mediator. however, the physiological role of cochlin in the inner ear is not completely understood. here, we report that cochlins containing dfna9-linked mutations (p.p51s, p.v66g, p.g88e, p.i109t, p.w117r, p.v123e, and p.c162y) demonstrate reduced cleavage by aggrecanase. notably, in families affected with dfna9, we found a novel coch mutation causing p.v123e substitution in cochlin, which significantly reduced protein susceptibility to cleavage by aggrecanase (to about 20.5% of the wild-type). these results suggest that the impaired post-translational cleavage of cochlin mutants may be associated with pathological mechanisms underlying dfna9-related sensorineural hearing loss.	1

biochemical characterization of mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase enzymes and correlation with clinical presentation in hyperphenylalaninaemic patients.  the biochemical properties of mutant phenylalanine hydroxylase (pah) enzymes and clinical characteristics of hyperphenylalaninaemic patients who bear these mutant enzymes were investigated. biochemical characterization of mutant pah enzymes p.d143g, p.r155h, p.l348v, p.r408w and p.p416q included determination of specific activity, substrate activation, v(max), k(m) for (6r)-l-erythro-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (bh(4)), k (d) for bh(4), and protein stabilization by bh(4). clinical data from 22 patients either homozygous, functionally hemizygous, or compound heterozygous for the mutant enzymes of interest were correlated with biochemical parameters of the mutant enzymes. the p.l348v and p.p416q enzymes retain significant catalytic activity yet were observed in classic and moderate pku patients. biochemical studies demonstrated that bh(4) rectified the stability defects in p.l348v and p.p416q; additionally, patients with these variants responded to bh(4) therapy. the p.r155h mutant displayed low pah activity and decreased apparent affinity for l-phe yet was observed in mild hyperphenylalaninaemia. the p.r155h mutant does not display kinetic instability, as it is stabilized by bh(4) similarly to wild-type pah; thus the residual activity is available under physiological conditions. the p.r408w enzyme is dysfunctional in nearly all biochemical parameters, as evidenced by disease severity in homozygous and hemizygous patients. biochemical assessment of mutant pah proteins, especially parameters involving interaction with bh(4) that impact protein folding, appear useful in clinical correlation. as additional patients and mutant proteins are assessed, the utility of this approach will become apparent.	-1
prevalent connexin 26 gene (gjb2) mutations in japanese.  the gene responsible for dnfb1 and dfna3, connexin 26 (gjb2), was recently identified and more than 20 disease causing mutations have been reported so far. this paper presents mutation analysis for gjb2 in japanese non-syndromic hearing loss patients compatible with recessive inheritance. it was confirmed that gjb2 mutations are an important cause of hearing loss in this population, with three mutations, 235delc, y136x, and r143w, especially frequent. of these three mutations, 235delc was most prevalent at 73%. surprisingly, the 35delg mutation, which is the most common gjb2 mutation in white subjects, was not found in the present study. our data indicated that specific combinations of gjb2 mutation exist in different populations.	-1
clinicopathological concordance and discordance in three monozygotic twin pairs with familial alzheimer's disease.  neuropathological examination of both individuals in a monozygotic (mz) twin pair with alzheimer's disease (ad) is rare, especially in the molecular genetic era. we had the opportunity to assess the concordance and discordance of clinical presentation and neuropathology in three mz twin pairs with ad. the mz twins were identified and characterised by the university of washington alzheimer's disease research center. we reviewed the available clinical and neuropathological records for all six cases looking specifically for concordance and discordance of clinical phenotype, neuritic amyloid plaques (np), neurofibrillary tangles (nft) and lewy related pathology (lrp). discordance in age of onset for developing ad in the mz twins varied from 4 to 18 years. clinical presentations also differed between twins. one twin presented with a dementia with lewy body clinical syndrome while the other presented with typical clinical ad. neuropathology within the mz twin pairs was concordant for np and nft, regardless of duration of disease, and was discordant for lrp. this difference was most marked in the late onset ad twin pair. one pair was found to have a mutation in presenilin-1 (ps1) (a79v) with remarkably late onset in a family member. mz twins with ad can vary considerably in age of onset, presentation and disease duration. the concordance of np and nft pathological change and the discordance of lrp support the concept that, in ad, the former are primarily under genetic control whereas the latter (lrp) is more influenced by disease duration and environmental factors. the a79v mutation in ps1 can be associated with very late onset of dementia.	-1
antenatal diagnosis of fetal genotype determines if maternal hyperglycemia due to a glucokinase mutation requires treatment.  in women with hyperglycemia due to heterozygous glucokinase (gck) mutations, the fetal genotype determines its growth. if the fetus inherits the mutation, birth weight is normal when maternal hyperglycemia is not treated, whereas intensive treatment may adversely reduce fetal growth. however, fetal genotype is not usually known antenatally, making treatment decisions difficult. we report two women with gestational diabetes mellitus resulting from gck mutations with hyperglycemia sufficient to merit treatment. in both women, dna from chorionic villus sampling, performed after high-risk aneuploidy screening, showed the fetus had inherited the gck mutation. therefore, maternal hyperglycemia was not treated. both offspring had a normal birth weight and no peripartum complications. in pregnancies where the mother has hyperglycemia due to a gck mutation, knowing the fetal gck genotype guides the management of maternal hyperglycemia. fetal genotyping should be performed when fetal dna is available from invasive prenatal diagnostic testing.	-1
microarray-based mutation analysis of 183 spanish families with usher syndrome.  the purpose of this study was to test the ability of the genotyping microarray for usher syndrome (ush) to identify the mutations responsible for the disease in a cohort of 183 patients with ush. dna from 183 patients with usher syndrome from the spanish population was analyzed using a genotyping microarray containing 429 previously identified disease-associated variants in eight ush genes. mutations detected by the array were confirmed by direct sequencing. haplotype analysis was also performed in families carrying common spanish mutations. the genotyping microarray identified 43 different variants, divided into 32 disease causative and 11 probably nonpathologic. mutations were detected in 62 patients with ush (33.9%). according to the clinical classification of patients, pathologic variants were detected in 31.4% patients with ush1, 39.4% of with ush2, 22.2% with ush3 and 15.8% with unclassified usher syndrome. ninety-seven pathologic alleles were detected, corresponding to 26.5% of expected alleles. the ush2a mutations p.c3267r and p.t3571m were revealed as common in the spanish population, and two major haplotypes linked to these mutations were observed. the genotyping microarray is a robust, low-cost, rapid technique that is effective for the genetic study of patients with ush. however, it also indicates variants of unclear pathologic nature and detection failures have also been observed. results must be confirmed by direct sequencing to avoid misdiagnosis, and continuous updates of the microarray should be performed to increase the efficiency and rate of detection of mutations.	-1
results of clinical genetic testing of 2,912 probands with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: expanded panels offer limited additional sensitivity.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is caused primarily by pathogenic variants in genes encoding sarcomere proteins. we report genetic testing results for hcm in 2,912 unrelated individuals with nonsyndromic presentations from a broad referral population over 10 years. genetic testing was performed by sanger sequencing for 10 genes from 2004 to 2007, by hcm cardiochip for 11 genes from 2007 to 2011 and by next-generation sequencing for 18, 46, or 51 genes from 2011 onward. the detection rate is ~32% among unselected probands, with inconclusive results in an additional 15%. detection rates were not significantly different between adult and pediatric probands but were higher in females compared with males. an expanded gene panel encompassing more than 50 genes identified only a very small number of additional pathogenic variants beyond those identifiable in our original panels, which examined 11 genes. familial genetic testing in at-risk family members eliminated the need for longitudinal cardiac evaluations in 691 individuals. based on the projected costs derived from medicare fee schedules for the recommended clinical evaluations of hcm family members by the american college of cardiology foundation/american heart association, our data indicate that genetic testing resulted in a minimum cost savings of about $0.7 million. clinical hcm genetic testing provides a definitive molecular diagnosis for many patients and provides cost savings to families. expanded gene panels have not substantively increased the clinical sensitivity of hcm testing, suggesting major additional causes of hcm still remain to be identified.	-1
prevalence of cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene mutations in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is a frequent, autosomal-dominant cardiac disease and manifests predominantly as left ventricular hypertrophy. mutations in the cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain gene (myh7) are responsible for the disease in about 30% of cases where mutations were identified. we clinically evaluated a large group of 147 consecutive hcm patients from three cardiology centers in germany, poland, and kyrgyzstan according to the same protocol. the dna of the patients was systematically analyzed in the whole coding region of the myh7 gene using pcr, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and automated sequencing. eleven different missense mutations (including seven novel ones) in 11 unrelated patients were identified, showing a mutation frequency of 7.5% in the study population. we further examined the families of five patients (three of german, one of polish, and one of kyrgyz origin) with 32 individuals in total. we observed a clear, age-dependent penetrance with onset of disease symptoms in the fourth decade of life. genotype-phenotype correlations were different for each mutation, whereas the majority was associated with an intermediate/malign phenotype. in conclusion, we report a systematic molecular screening of the complete myh7 gene in a large group of consecutive hcm patients, leading to a genetic diagnosis in 38 individuals. information about the genotype in an individual from one family could be very useful for the clinician, especially when dealing with healthy relatives in doubt of their risk about developing hcm. the increasing application of genetic screening and the increasing knowledge about genotype-phenotype correlations will hopefully lead to an improved clinical management of hcm patients.	-1
specificity of slc26a4 mutations in the pathogenesis of inner ear malformations.  the traditional hypothesis concerning the pathogenesis of inner ear malformations holds that various types of malformations represent different stages of developmental arrest during embryogenesis. in order to verify this hypothesis, we surveyed mutations in the slc26a4(pds) gene, which were documented to cause enlarged vestibular aqueduct (eva) and mondini's dysplasia (incomplete partition of the cochlea), in 35 families with various types of inner ear malformations. in 25 families, the probands showed eva or mondini's dysplasia as the main temporal bone abnormalities, whereas the probands in the remaining 10 families revealed other types of malformations. in total, 7 mutated slc26a4 alleles, including 6 missense mutations (a372v, a387v, t410m, s448l, t721m, and h723r) and 1 splice site mutation (ivs7-2a-->g), were detected. all mutated alleles segregated the malformations of eva and mondini's dysplasia, whereas no mutated alleles were found in the 10 probands with other types of malformations. slc26a4 mutations were found in 22 of the 25 probands with eva or mondini's dysplasia, indicating that these might be specific to the development of mondini's dysplasia and eva. it is inferred that the pathogenetic mechanisms of the various malformations essentially differ, although their radiological findings appear to follow a continuum of morphological changes.	-1
tp53 germline mutation testing in 180 families suspected of li-fraumeni syndrome: mutation detection rate and relative frequency of cancers in different familial phenotypes.  background li-fraumeni syndrome (lfs) is a rare autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome. most families fulfilling the classical diagnostic criteria harbour tp53 germline mutations. however, tp53 germline mutations may also occur in less obvious phenotypes. as a result, different criteria are in use to decide which patients qualify for tp53 mutation analysis, including the lfs, li-fraumeni-like (lfl) and chompret criteria. we investigated which criteria for tp53 mutation analysis resulted in the highest mutation detection rate and sensitivity in dutch families. we describe the tumour spectrum in tp53-positive families and calculated tumour type specific relative risks. method a total of 180 dutch families referred for tp53 mutation analysis were evaluated. tumour phenotypes were verified by pathology reports or clinical records. results a tp53 germline mutation was identified in 24 families. when the chompret criteria were used 22/24 mutations were detected (sensitivity 92%, mutation detection rate 21%). in lfs and lfl families 18/24 mutations were found (sensitivity 75%). the two mutations detected outside the 'chompret group' were found in a child with rhabdomyosarcoma and a young woman with breast cancer. in the mutation carriers, in addition to the classical lfs tumour types, colon and pancreatic cancer were also found significantly more often than in the general population. conclusion we suggest tp53 mutation testing for all families fulfilling the chompret criteria. in addition, tp53 mutation testing can be considered in the event of childhood sarcoma and breast cancer before 30 years. in addition to the risk for established lfs tumour types, tp53-positive individuals may also have an elevated risk for pancreatic and colon cancer.	-1
expansion of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum in patients with kras germline mutations.  noonan syndrome, cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (cfc) and costello syndrome constitute a group of developmental disorders with an overlapping pattern of congenital anomalies. each of these conditions can be caused by germline mutations in key components of the highly conserved ras-mapk pathway, possibly reflecting a similar pathogenesis underlying the three disorders. germline mutations in kras have recently been identified in a small number of patients with noonan syndrome and cfc. 260 patients were screened for kras mutations by direct sequencing. overall, we detected kras mutations in 12 patients, including three known and eight novel sequence alterations. all mutations are predicted to cause single amino acid substitutions. remarkably, our cohort of individuals with kras mutations showed a high clinical variability, ranging from noonan syndrome to cfc, and also included two patients who met the clinical criteria of costello syndrome. our findings reinforce the picture of a clustered distribution of disease associated kras germline alterations. we further defined the phenotypic spectrum associated with kras missense mutations and provided the first evidence of clinical differences in patients with kras mutations compared with noonan syndrome affected individuals with heterozygous ptpn11 mutations and cfc patients carrying a braf, mek1 or mek1 alteration, respectively. we speculate that the observed phenotypic variability may be related, at least in part, to specific genotypes and possibly reflects the central role of k-ras in a number of different signalling pathways.	-1

[genetic and clinical study of three chinese pedigrees with fabry disease].  fabry disease is a rare lysosome storage disease featuring x-linked recessive inheritance. the study was to explore potential mutations of alpha-galactosidase a (gla) gene and their correlation with clinic manifestations in three chinese pedigrees with fabry disease. all exons and flanking sequences of gla gene were amplified with pcr. potential mutations were detected with bidirectional dna sequencing. correlation between particular mutations and clinic features were analyzed. a unreported missense mutation, c.797a>c (d266a) in gla exon 5 was identified in pedigree 1. also in exon 5, a missense mutation c.644a>g (n215s) was found in pedigree 2. in pedigree 3, a nonsense mutation c.355c>t (q119x) was found in exon 2. the c.797a>c mutation was not detected in 200 unrelated male controls. the probands of pedigrees 1 and 3 had presented mainly with skin damage and chronic renal insufficiency, whilst the proband of pedigree 2 had presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. the unreported c.797a>c (d266a) mutation is the sixth missense type mutation of the 266th codon of gla gene, and all other 5 missense mutations reported previously had been confirmed to be responsible for fabry disease. the c.797a>c mutation, not found in 200 unrelated male controls, may be the causative mutation in pedigree 1. the c.644a>g and c.355c>t mutations were first detected in chinese patients. variable phenotypes of fabry disease may be in part attributed to the natures of particular mutations of gla gene.	1
bach1 is critical for homologous recombination and appears to be the fanconi anemia gene product fancj.  we showed in this study that cells deficient of the brca1-associated bach1 helicase, also known as brip1, failed to elicit homologous recombination (hr) after dna double-stranded breaks (dsbs). bach1-deficient cells were also sensitive to mitomycin c (mmc) and underwent mmc-induced chromosome instability. moreover, we identified a homozygous nonsense mutation in bach1 in a fa-j patient-derived cell line and could not detect bach1 protein in this cell line. expression of wild-type bach1 in this cell line reduced the accumulation of cells at g2/m phases following exposure to dna crosslinkers, a characteristic of fanconi anemia (fa) cells. these results support the conclusion that bach1 is fancj.	1

identification and characterization of ldl receptor gene mutations in hyperlipidemic chinese.  dna screening for ldl receptor mutations was performed in 170 unrelated hyperlipidemic chinese patients and two clinically diagnosed familial hypercholesterolemia patients. two deletions (del e3-5 and del e6-8), eight point mutations (w-18x, d69n, r94h, e207k, c308y, i402t, a410t, and a696g), and two polymorphisms (a370t and i602v) were identified. of these mutations, c308y and del e6-8 were found in homozygosity, and d69n and c308y were seen in unrelated patients. the effects of mutations on ldl receptor function were characterized in cos-7 cells. the ldl receptor level and activity were close to those of wild type in a696g transfected cells. a novel intermediate protein and reduction of ldl receptor activity were seen in d69n transfected cells. for r94h, e207k, c308y, i402t, and a410t mutations, only approximately 20-64% of normal receptor activities were seen. conversely, del e3-5 and del e6-8 lead to defective proteins with approximately 0-13% activity. most of the mutant receptors were localized intracellularly, with a staining pattern resembling that of the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus (d69n, r94h, e207k, c308y, and i402t) or endosome/lysosome (a410t and del e6-8). molecular analysis of the ldl receptor gene will clearly identify the cause of the patient's hyperlipidemia and allow appropriate early treatment as well as antenatal and family studies.	1
paneltesting reveals nonsense and missense cdh1 mutations in families without hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.  the reported penetrance of germline cdh1 mutations is high in families with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (hdgc). men and women have a 70% and 56%, respectively, cumulative risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer by age 80. women additionally have a 42% cumulative risk of developing breast cancer. due to the high penetrance of these mutations, prophylactic total gastrectomy is currently recommended for cdh1 mutation carriers. however, whether everyone with a cdh1 gene mutation is at risk for hdgc is not clear. mutation identification was performed by next-generation sequencing. mutations and variant status was confirmed by sanger sequencing in 11 family members. we present two families with pathogenic cdh1 mutations. the first family carries a novel truncating, nonsense cdh1 mutation that we were able to trace for three generations, but reports no family history of diffuse gastric cancer. the occurrence of cancer in this family deviates significantly from the expectation for hdgc. the proband from the second family presents with breast cancer and carries a previously reported pathogenic cdh1 mutation, but also reports no family history of diffuse gastric cancer. our study demonstrates the need for further analysis of cdh1 mutation penetrance in order to better counsel asymptomatic cdh1 mutation carriers on preventative measures and general care.	-1
a de novo mutation of the beta cardiac myosin heavy chain gene in an infantile restrictive cardiomyopathy.  here we report the first pediatric case of restrictive cardiomyopathy secondary to a de novo mutation in the cardiac myosin heavy chain gene myh7. the clinical course is characterized by an early onset of disease, mild hypertrophy of the left ventricle and a very short evolution to death. because of the location of the mutation in the hinge region between the rod part and the globular head of the myosin molecule, it is possible that restrictive cardiomyopathy resulted from an impairment of flexion/extension of myosin heads during the contraction/relaxation cycle.	-1
late-onset glycogen storage disease type ii (pompe's disease) with a novel mutation: a malaysian experience.  pompe's disease (acid maltase deficiency, glycogen storage disease type ii) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid ?-1,4-glucosidase, resulting in excessive accumulation of glycogen in the lysosomes and cytoplasm of all tissues, most notably in skeletal muscles. we present a case of adult-onset pompe's disease with progressive proximal muscles weakness over 5 years and respiratory failure on admission, requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. electromyography showed evidence of myopathic process with small amplitudes, polyphasic motor unit action potentials, and presence of pseudomyotonic discharges. muscle biopsy showed glycogen-containing vacuoles in the muscle fibers consistent with glycogen storage disease. genetic analysis revealed two compound heterozygous mutations at c.444c>g (p.tyr148*) in exon 2 and c.2238g>c (p.trp746cys) in exon 16, with the former being a novel mutation. this mutation has not been reported before, to our knowledge. the patient was treated with high protein diet during the admission and subsequently showed good clinical response to enzyme replacement therapy with survival now to the eighth year. conclusion. in patients with late-onset adult pompe's disease, careful evaluation and early identification of the disease and its treatment with high protein diet and enzyme replacement therapy improve muscle function and have beneficial impact on long term survival.	-1
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in pompe disease is not limited to the classic infantile-onset phenotype.  pompe disease is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of acid ?-glucosidase (gaa). patients with classic infantile-onset pompe disease usually present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and die before 1 year of age, if not treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ert). in comparison, patients with late-onset pompe disease typically do not have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. however, here we describe five patients who presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but did not fit the criteria of classic infantile-onset pompe disease. their ages at diagnosis of cardiomyopathy were 1 month in two patients following detection of an audible cardiac murmur and 2-3 years in the three remaining patients. all patients survived for 5-8 years without ert. three patients died before the advent of ert from causes other than congestive heart failure. one patient had a good response to ert starting at 5 years of age. the sibling of one patient, who did not receive ert and died at age seven, was diagnosed prenatally. at 3 months of age, the sibling had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and a muscle biopsy at that time revealed glycogen accumulation.this case series demonstrates that pompe disease is a continuum of disease, and the development of cardiomyopathy is not limited to classic infantile-onset pompe disease. these patients do not fit into the discrete phenotypes of infantile- or late-onset pompe disease, which may suggest reconsidering the nomenclature of pompe disease.	-1
assessing the phenotypic effects in the general population of rare variants in genes for a dominant mendelian form of diabetes.  genome sequencing can identify individuals in the general population who harbor rare coding variants in genes for mendelian disorders and who may consequently have increased disease risk. previous studies of rare variants in phenotypically extreme individuals display ascertainment bias and may demonstrate inflated effect-size estimates. we sequenced seven genes for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (mody) in well-phenotyped population samples (n = 4,003). we filtered rare variants according to two prediction criteria for disease-causing mutations: reported previously in mody or satisfying stringent de novo thresholds (rare, conserved and protein damaging). approximately 1.5% and 0.5% of randomly selected individuals from the framingham and jackson heart studies, respectively, carry variants from these two classes. however, the vast majority of carriers remain euglycemic through middle age. accurate estimates of variant effect sizes from population-based sequencing are needed to avoid falsely predicting a substantial fraction of individuals as being at risk for mody or other mendelian diseases.	-1
the metabolic and molecular bases of tetrahydrobiopterin-responsive phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.  about two-thirds of all mild phenylketonuria (pku) patients are tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4)-responsive and thus can be potentially treated with bh4 instead of a low-phenylalanine diet. although there has been an increase in the amount of information relating to the diagnosis and treatment of this new variant of pku, very little is know about the mechanisms of bh4-responsiveness. this review will focus on laboratory investigations and possible molecular and structural mechanisms involved in this process.	-1
early results of sarcomeric gene screening from the egyptian national ba-hcm program.  the present study comprised sarcomeric genotyping of the three most commonly involved sarcomeric genes: mybpc3, myh7, and tnnt2 in 192 unrelated egyptian hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) index patients. mutations were detected in 40 % of cases. presence of positive family history was significantly (p=0.002) associated with a higher genetic positive yield (49/78, 62.8 %). the majority of the detected mutations in the three sarcomeric genes were novel (40/62, 65 %) and mostly private (47/62, 77 %). single nucleotide substitution was the most frequently detected mutation type (51/62, 82 %). over three quarters of these substitutions (21/27, 78 %) involved cpg dinucleotide sites and resulted from c>t or g>a transition in the three analyzed genes, highlighting the significance of cpg high mutability within the sarcomeric genes examined. this study could aid in global comparative studies in different ethnic populations and constitutes an important step in the evolution of the integrated clinical, translational, and basic science hcm program.	-1
pilot study of newborn screening for six lysosomal storage diseases using tandem mass spectrometry.  there is current expansion of newborn screening (nbs) programs to include lysosomal storage disorders because of the availability of treatments that produce an optimal clinical outcome when started early in life. to evaluate the performance of a multiplex-tandem mass spectrometry (ms/ms) enzymatic activity assay of 6 lysosomal enzymes in a nbs laboratory for the identification of newborns at risk for developing pompe, mucopolysaccharidosis-i (mps-i), fabry, gaucher, niemann pick-a/b, and krabbe diseases. enzyme activities (acid ?-glucosidase (gaa), galactocerebrosidase (galc), glucocerebrosidase (gba), ?-galactosidase a (gla), ?-iduronidase (idua) and sphingomyeline phosphodiesterase-1 (smpd-1)) were measured on ~43,000 de-identified dried blood spot (dbs) punches, and screen positive samples were submitted for dna sequencing to obtain genotype confirmation of disease risk. the 6-plex assay was efficiently performed in the washington state nbs laboratory by a single laboratory technician at the bench using a single ms/ms instrument. the number of screen positive samples per 100,000 newborns were as follows: gaa (4.5), idua (13.6), gla (18.2), smpd1 (11.4), gba (6.8), and galc (25.0). a 6-plex ms/ms assay for 6 lysosomal enzymes can be successfully performed in a nbs laboratory. the analytical ranges (enzyme-dependent assay response for the quality control high sample divided by that for all enzyme-independent processes) for the 6-enzymes with the ms/ms is 5- to 15-fold higher than comparable fluorimetric assays using 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates. the rate of screen positive detection is consistently lower for the ms/ms assay compared to the fluorimetric assay using a digital microfluidics platform.	1
sarcomere gene mutations are associated with increased cardiovascular events in left ventricular hypertrophy: results from multicenter registration in japan.  this study investigated the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertensive heart disease (hhd) or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) with or without sarcomere gene mutations. although hhd and hcm are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh), few data exist regarding the difference in prognosis between them. we enrolled 256 patients with lvh (>13 mm) screened for sarcomere gene mutations. we divided them into 3 groups: the first had hhd without sarcomere gene mutations (group h), the second had sarcomere gene mutations (group g), and the third had neither sarcomere gene mutations nor hhd (group ng). we compared the occurrence of sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation, admission for heart failure, and atrial fibrillation for 1 year. group g (n = 78, 36 men; mean age, 53.4 years) experienced more total cardiovascular events than group h (n = 45, 32 men; mean age, 67.4 years) (p = 0.042) after adjustments for age and sex, although there was no significant difference in total cardiovascular events between groups h and ng (n = 98, 66 men; mean age, 62.0 years). with kaplan-meier analysis, group g exhibited a significantly higher incidence of admission for heart failure (p = 0.017) and atrial fibrillation (p = 0.045) than group h in those 50 years of age and older. additionally, there was a significant difference in total cardiovascular events between groups g and ng (p = 0.021). these results demonstrate that hcm with sarcomere gene mutations can be associated with increased cardiovascular events compared with hhd or hcm without sarcomere gene mutations.	-1
clinical and metabolic features of adult-onset diabetes caused by abcc8 mutations.  gain-of-function abcc8/sulfonylurea (su) receptor 1 mutations cause neonatal diabetes mellitus (ndm) or late-onset diabetes in adult relatives. given the effectiveness of su treatment in abcc8-ndm patients, we further characterized late-onset abcc8-associated diabetes. seven adult subjects from three ndm families and one family with type 2 diabetes were studied. insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were assessed using clamp techniques. we screened 139 type 2 diabetic patients who were well controlled by su for abcc8 mutations. abcc8 mutation carriers exhibited glucose intolerance, frank diabetes, or insulin-requiring diabetes since diagnosis. hba(1c) improved in five su-treated patients. insulin secretion capacity was impaired in three patients compared with adult control subjects but was restored after a 4-week su trial in two patients. cohort screening revealed four su-treated patients with abcc8 mutations, two of which are likely causal. although of rare occurrence, recognition of adult-onset abcc8-associated diabetes may help in targeting patients for su therapy.	-1
functional consequences of novel connexin 26 mutations associated with hereditary hearing loss.  in a study of 530 individuals with non-syndromic, sensorineural hearing loss, we identified 18 mutations at connexin 26 (cx26), four of which are novel (-23g>t, i33t, 377_383duptccgcat, w172r) and the remaining 14 (ivs1+1g>a, m1v, 35delg, w24x, i35s, v37i, r75w, w77x, 312del14, e120del, q124x, y136x, r143w, r184p) being mutations previously described. to gain insight into functional consequences of these mutations, cellular localization of the mutant proteins and their ability to permit lucifer yellow transfer between cells was studied in seven of them (w24x, i33t, i35s, r75w, e120del, w172r and r184p). i35s and r184p showed impaired trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane. i33t, r75w, e120del and w172r showed predominantly membrane localization but did not form functional gap junction channels. surprisingly, w24x, a protein-truncating mutation, apparently permits formation of a full-length protein, perhaps due to a stop codon read-through mechanism. these results provide further evidence that cx26 mutations affect gap junction activity by mis-regulation at multiple levels.	1
a substitution of cysteine for arginine 614 in the ryanodine receptor is potentially causative of human malignant hyperthermia.  malignant hyperthermia (mh) is a devastating, potentially lethal response to anesthetics that occurs in genetically predisposed individuals. the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (ryr1) gene has been linked to porcine and human mh. furthermore, a cys for arg substitution tightly linked to, and potentially causative of, porcine mh has been identified in the ryanodine receptor. analysis of 35 human families predisposed to malignant hyperthermia has revealed the presence, and cosegregation with phenotype, of the corresponding substitution in a single family. this substitution, by analogy to the findings in pig, may be causal for predisposition to mh in this family.	-1
activating mutations in the abcc8 gene in neonatal diabetes mellitus.  the atp-sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channel, composed of the beta-cell proteins sulfonylurea receptor (sur1) and inward-rectifying potassium channel subunit kir6.2, is a key regulator of insulin release. it is inhibited by the binding of adenine nucleotides to subunit kir6.2, which closes the channel, and activated by nucleotide binding or hydrolysis on sur1, which opens the channel. the balance of these opposing actions determines the low open-channel probability, p(o), which controls the excitability of pancreatic beta cells. we hypothesized that activating mutations in abcc8, which encodes sur1, cause neonatal diabetes. we screened the 39 exons of abcc8 in 34 patients with permanent or transient neonatal diabetes of unknown origin. we assayed the electrophysiologic activity of mutant and wild-type k(atp) channels. we identified seven missense mutations in nine patients. four mutations were familial and showed vertical transmission with neonatal and adult-onset diabetes; the remaining mutations were not transmitted and not found in more than 300 patients without diabetes or with early-onset diabetes of similar genetic background. mutant channels in intact cells and in physiologic concentrations of magnesium atp had a markedly higher p(o) than did wild-type channels. these overactive channels remained sensitive to sulfonylurea, and treatment with sulfonylureas resulted in euglycemia. dominant mutations in abcc8 accounted for 12 percent of cases of neonatal diabetes in the study group. diabetes results from a newly discovered mechanism whereby the basal magnesium-nucleotide-dependent stimulatory action of sur1 on the kir pore is elevated and blockade by sulfonylureas is preserved.	-1
