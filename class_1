"Response of 33 UK patients with infantile-onset Pompe disease to enzyme replacement therapy. ||  || Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for infantile-onset Pompe disease has been commercially available for almost 10 years. We report the experience of its use in a cohort treated at three specialist lysosomal treatment centres in the UK. A retrospective case-note review was performed, with additional data being gathered from two national audits on all such patients treated with ERT. The impact on the outcome of various characteristics, measured just prior to the initiation of ERT (baseline), was evaluated using logistic regression. Thirty-three patients were identified; 13/29 (45%) were cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) negative, and nine were immunomodulated. At baseline assessment, 79% were in heart failure, 66% had failure to thrive and 70% had radiological signs of focal pulmonary collapse. The overall survival rate was 60%, ventilation-free survival was 40% and 30% of patients were ambulatory. Median follow-up of survivors was 4 years, 1.5 months (range 6 months to 13.5 years). As with previous studies, the CRIM status impacted on all outcome measures. However, in this cohort, baseline failure to thrive was related to death and lack of ambulation, and left ventricular dilatation was a risk factor for non-ventilator-free survival. The outcome of treated patients remains heterogeneous despite attempts at immunomodulation. Failure to thrive at baseline and left ventricular dilation appear to be associated with poorer outcomes.",3 1
"Pompe disease: dramatic improvement in gastrointestinal function following enzyme replacement therapy. A report of three later-onset patients. || Adolescent Adult Child Child, Preschool Enzyme Replacement Therapy Female Gastrointestinal Diseases Gastrointestinal Tract Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Male Middle Aged alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disease due to deficient acid α-glucosidase (GAA) activity. Infants with the classic infantile-onset subtype present with severe hypotonia and cardiomegaly, and most expire in the first year of life, whereas the severity of the muscle-based manifestations in patients with the late infantile/juvenile and adult-onset subtypes depends on the level of GAA residual enzymatic activity. The clinical features of later-onset Pompe disease are still emerging, and even the natural history and progression of muscle weakness and respiratory failure, hallmarks of the later-onset subtypes, are not well documented. For example, we report here three later-onset patients who had chronic diarrhea, postprandial bloating and abdominal pain, previously unrecognized manifestations of later-onset Pompe disease. Two patients had intestinal incontinence and one reported synchronous vomiting and diarrhea on a daily basis. These symptoms significantly interfered with their quality of life, often limiting their ability to leave home. All gastrointestinal symptoms resolved within the first six months of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant human alglucosidase alpha (rhGAA). All three patients gained weight and remain symptom free, two for over four years. Thus, gastrointestinal symptoms occur in later-onset patients with Pompe disease and are resolved with ERT.",1
"Enlarged vestibular aqueduct: a radiological marker of pendred syndrome, and mutation of the PDS gene. || Adolescent Adult Biomarkers Carrier Proteins Child Child, Preschool Deafness Goiter Humans Infant Membrane Transport Proteins Middle Aged Mutation Sulfate Transporters Syndrome Tomography, X-Ray Computed Vestibular Aqueduct || Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Since this is the most common radiological malformation of the cochlea in deaf patients, we investigated what proportion of such cases were due to mutation of the PDS gene. We assessed 57 patients referred with radiological evidence of vestibular aqueduct enlargement, by history, clinical examination, perchlorate discharge test and molecular analysis of the PDS locus. Forty-one patients (72%) had unequivocal evidence of Pendred syndrome. The finding of a single heterozygous mutation at the PDS gene in a further eight was strongly suggestive of a critical role for pendrin, the protein product of the PDS gene, in the generation of enlarged vestibular aqueducts in at least 86% (49/57 cases) of patients with this radiological malformation. Securing the diagnosis of Pendred syndrome may be difficult, especially in the single case. Goitre is an inconstant finding, and the perchlorate discharge test, although helpful, is of diagnostic value only if abnormal. Enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct should be considered as the most likely presentation of Pendred syndrome and should prompt specific investigation of that diagnostic possibility. Pendred syndrome might henceforth be recharacterized as deafness with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, which is sometimes associated with goitre.",3 1 4
"Molecular analysis and protein processing in late-onset Pompe disease patients with low levels of acid α-glucosidase activity. || Adolescent Adult Age of Onset Aged Blotting, Western Child Enzyme Activation Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Middle Aged Mutation Protein Modification, Translational Young Adult alpha-Glucosidases || Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II, acid maltase deficiency) is caused by deficiency of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA). A few late-onset patients have been reported with skin fibroblast GAA activity levels of <2%. We measured GAA activity in skin fibroblasts from 101 patients with late-onset Pompe disease. Whenever possible, we performed Western blot analysis and correlated the results with GAA activity and GAA gene mutations. Thirteen patients (13%) had skin fibroblast GAA activity of <1% of normal. Although there was wide genetic heterogeneity, none of these patients carried the common late-onset mutation c.-32-13T > G. We performed Western blot on 11 patients with <1% GAA activity. All produced GAA protein that was at lower levels and/or was abnormally processed. There is no common mutation associated with <1% GAA activity in late-onset Pompe disease patients. Most patients produce unprocessed forms of GAA protein compared with patients with higher GAA activity.",3 1 4
"Detecting multiple lysosomal storage diseases by tandem mass spectrometry--a national newborn screening program in Taiwan. || DNA Dried Blood Spot Testing Fabry Disease Female Gaucher Disease Glycogen Storage Disease Type II Humans Infant, Newborn Lysosomal Storage Diseases Male Neonatal Screening Pilot Projects Quality Control Reproducibility of Results Sequence Analysis, DNA Taiwan Tandem Mass Spectrometry || Interest in lysosomal storage diseases in newborn screening programs has increased in recent years. Two techniques, fluorescence (4-MU) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) methods are frequently used. We report a pilot study of large scale newborn screening for Fabry, Pompe, Gaucher, and MPS I diseases by using the MS/MS method in Taiwan and compared the performance of the MS/MS with 4-MU methods. More than 100,000 dried blood spots (DBSs) were collected consecutively as part of the national Taiwan newborn screening programs. The enzyme activities were detected by the MS/MS method from a DBS punch. Mutation analysis was further performed for newborns with detected enzyme deficiency. The DNA sequence analysis for suspected cases revealed 64 newborns with confirmed Fabry mutations, 16 were classified as infantile or late-onset Pompe disease, and 1 was characterized as Gaucher disease. The positive predict value increased from 4.0% to 7.1% in the Pompe study, and from 61.0% to 95.5% in the Fabry study by the MS/MS method compared to 4-MU assay. The MS/MS method has been validated as a more specific, powerful and efficient tool than the 4-MU assay. It also provided a multiplex solution of newborn screening for lysosomal storage diseases.",3 1
